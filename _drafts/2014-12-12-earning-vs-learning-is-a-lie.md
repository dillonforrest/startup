title: '"Earning vs. Learning" is a lie'

Mark Suster wrote a few <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/04/is-it-time-for-you-to-earn-or-to-learn/" target="_blank">famous</a> <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/11/29/the-very-first-startup-founder-you-need-to-invest-in-is-you/" target="_blank">posts</a> about his philosophy on compensation.

In summary, he believes that when you're considering a job at a startup, you should also consider whether you prefer earning more money or learning more.  Earning versus Learning.  If you prefer to learn, then you should be happy taking a dip in compensation for the learning opportunity at the startup.  "Learn now to earn later," says Mark.

I think Mark's idea is a good idea.  It's well founded in realistic expectations and math.  I encourage reading the posts.  However, other startup founders will take Mark's "earning vs learning" framework and twist it in their favor to convince people to take paycuts.

At my last startup job, I knew I much preferred learning over earning.  My employer had the typical startup compensation model where they expected everybody to take a paycut.  I was no different, so I took the paycut expecting that the chances to learn and grow at my new job would more than make up for my compensation.

I was wrong.  I was so, so, so fucking wrong.  The startup job turned out to be several long strides backward from my previous job.  Not only was I earning a pathetic junior developer salary, but I was also doing boring grunt engineering with inexperienced leadership.  I wasn't learning or earning.  I was just wasting a full year of my twenties, a period which was supposed to be one of the most productive of my entire life.  I waited out the rest of my first year so I could buy my options and left as soon as I could after that.

Now, I'm unemployed and trying to start a company.  I am earning literally zero right now.  However, I'm actually learning.  This entire blog is detailing just a fraction of everything I've learned, and it's been only 8 weeks.  Now, finally, is when Mark's "earning vs learning" framework applies accurately to me.
