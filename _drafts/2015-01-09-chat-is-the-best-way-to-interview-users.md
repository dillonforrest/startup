title: "Chat is the best way to interview users"
---

When you're starting a company, you need to gather information from your users and customers.

Most books and startup literature advocate interviewing users in person, or at worst over the phone. The argument is that you can learn more by talking to people in person in real-time.  I tried researching the market with in-person interviews, video chats, and phone calls, but I'm overall dissatisfied with these real-time mediums for communication.

In my opinion, the best way to conduct these user interviews is by chat, just classic online instant messaging.

# Fortunate improvisation

Last month, the product idea I was pursuing was user analytics for single-page apps. I was talking to technical cofounders of startups using modern single-page app frameworks.

One day, while I still searched for more founders to get more market feedback, <a href="https://twitter.com/JdotJdotF" target="_blank">J.J. Fliegelman</a> and I started talking on gchat. J.J. and I are college classmates and also fellow <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/" target="_blank">Hacker Schoolers</a>, and now he runs <a href="https://www.campusjob.com/#!/" target="_blank">Campus Job</a>. At that moment, I realized that J.J. hacks on a single-page app for Campus Job, and he was perfect to speak with for my product idea.

> Me: "hey btw, can i talk to you about your analytics workflow with your single-page app?"
> 
> J.J.: "sure!"
> 
> Me: "okay cool! can i meet up with you at some point to talk about it?"
> 
> J.J.: "sorry dude, but things have been so busy that actually now is always the best time to talk to me"

Campus Job is picking up a lot of press, and I'm really stoked for J.J.! But his traction also meant that it was difficult for him to make time to meet up to help me gather feedback.

> J.J.: "wanna just ask me about it now on gchat?"

I said, fuck it let's do it! All startup advice advocated speaking to people in person, or at least by video chat or phone call, but let's improvise here.

J.J. unloaded plenty of great feedback right then and there on gchat. Receiving this feedback while on gchat had a ton of unforeseen benefits:

#### No note-taking means being more present in the interview

You'll already have everything your interviewee had to say in writing. You can scroll up to reread anything during the chat. And since you're not wasting any brainpower on capturing notes, you can dedicate all your brainpower to being present in the actual interview, which is what you should be investing 100% of your brainpower into anyway. After the chat is over, you have everything down in your computer, probably in the cloud, verbatim, accessible at any time.

#### Sharing links

This is a benefit which doesn't seem highly useful at first. However, when you need to share a link, you're super grateful to have the option. It's the fastest way to get the other person up-to-speed on topics for which they're unfamiliar.

#### Eliminate all misspellings and misunderstandings

For my in-person interviews and video chats, I almost always misspelled critical words, like names of competing products or authors of relevant content. None of these problems exist with chat.

#### Chat is still synchronous

Chat still has the presence of an in-person interview, video chat, or phone call. You want your interviews to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time. You might think that chat will be more like texting, a bit too slow, but that's not the case. Chat is synchronous enough to get all the information you want in that small timeframe.

#### No extra planning required

Arranging in-person chats, video chats, and phone calls all require extra communication to arrange the interview. That extra communication costs a lot of extra time. Chat can be spontaneous. Chat can avoid those unnecessary time sinks for the extra communication to plan. If you and the interviewee aren't close enough to have each other in your chat lists, then you can send a brief email asking if they want to talk about your idea via chat. Add them to your chat list, then chat them whenever you're both online.

#### Extra time to think about your questions

I'm not sure if others would relate to this benefit. But for me, it's easier to think about what I want to say with chat rather than talking in-person or over the phone. I see my words physically typed out before I hit Enter to send my instant message.

One way this is useful for me is to help avoid closed-ended questions. Open-ended questions are immensely preferable to closed-ended questions so your interviewee can give you more information. Open-ended questions are your primary tool to gather lots of information in a short amount of time. With chat, I personally can make sure I'm avoiding asking dumb closed-ended questions, saving both of our time.

#### It's easier to ask somebody to chat than to ask somebody to meet in-person

Asking to chat is a much smaller ask than asking to meet in-person, or even video chat or call on the phone. The smaller the ask, the more likely they'll say yes, and the faster you can get feedback.

# When is chat a bad idea for an interview?

Some people are just bad to chat with. Most people who won't do chat well are people in different generations. Unfortunately, you'll have to stick with old-fashioned phone calls and in-person interviews with them.

Otherwise, currently I don't see any downside to chat. In the foreseeable future, chat will be my primary medium for my user interviews.
