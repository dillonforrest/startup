title: "It's like I'm redoing Hacker School"
---

My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlSednaoui" target="_blank">Carl Sednaoui</a> regularly gives me insight into my journey.  He's a fellow Hacker Schooler in addition to one of the minds behind <a href="http://www.mailcharts.com/" target="_blank">MailCharts</a>, an email marketing tool.

<a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/" target="_blank">Hacker School</a> is a retreat for programmers to dabble with whatever projects interest them with the general goal to just become a better programmer.  Carl mentioned that my journey was similar to Hacker School in that I'm doing so much experimentation and intrinsically motivated learning.

I'm glad Carl told me that.  He's right.  Intrinsically motivated learning is the most rewarding learning there is, at least in my view.  It's nice to keep that in mind because it emphasizes a few key concepts.

The first is that it's okay to not make money as long as you're learning.  Every day you're not making money should be a day you're better prepared to make money.  One of my <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-criteria-for-success/" target="_blank">goals</a> is simply learning to be an entrepreneur.

The second is that progress is generally slow and steady.  Hacker School invariably teaches you that it's a long journey to become as good of a programmer as you'd want to be.  Similarly, becoming a savvy founder takes time.  Celebrate the small wins.  Don't fret over the lack of major progress.

The third is humility.  Hacker School is very humbling in that you're surrounded by amazingly brilliant programmers, some who have been professional developers for decades maybe.  My startup journey thus far led me to meet many different founders, all of whom offered great feedback and advice, all of whom made me realize how much I have to learn.

Carl's right.  It's like I'm redoing Hacker School.  That's a good thing.

I'm still not sure where this journey will take me, but I'm happy I did it.  Schools and jobs are not the only places you can learn.  You can follow the Hacker School way and be your own teacher.
