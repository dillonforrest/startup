title: "My workflow to stay organized"
---

Organization was never my strong suit. I was always organized enough, but never super organized. That's changed recently, as I wanted to proactively stay ahead of the evergrowing to-do list and keep my head above water.

Picking the right workflow and tools is critical for staying organized. A human brain can only store so much information at once. We should rely on tools and habit to make everything awesome.

Here's my current workflow.

# My main tool for organization is Trello

Most of you probably heard of <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> by now. Yes, there are tons of alternatives. No, I haven't tried all of them. I previously used Trello and never had problems with it, so I stuck with Trello this time around too. It's free for one-person organizations like myself, which was the main reason why I stuck with Trello without checking out others like Basecamp or Asana.

I mainly use Trello to organize my current week and any future work. Every day I work gets its own separate "Done" list to make sure I'm doing something meaningful every day.

# My second-favorite tool is iDoneThis

<a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a> is more positioned for teams, but it's also free for one person, so I signed up and gave it a shot. Turns out I really, really like it. I find that it complements the way I use Trello: while I use Trello to organize my future, I use iDoneThis to measure my past.

I don't use iDoneThis to its fullest extent. I think a lot of my workflow with Trello could possibly be replaced by iDoneThis features. But I love my daily iDoneThis email. My favorite emails from them are the ones which remind me what I did one week, two weeks, or a month ago. Sometimes I get tunnel vision and get discouraged by not having the progress that I want. But then I see what I did two weeks ago, and I'll be excited again about everything I actually did.

You don't have many constant sources of encouragement as a first-time entrepreneur, but iDoneThis is definitely one of them.

# I now live by Google Calendar

Before attempting to start up, I didn't really use my calendar for anything. I usually remembered all my commitments. Now, I'm not sure how I got by without the calendar.

I used to hate it when people sent me calendar invites. Now I live by them. I send them myself to other people now. When I predict that they'll receive my invite with distaste, I preemptively apologize for being THAT GUY who wants to send calendar invites for something chill like a coffee to catch up. I will not remember anything anymore unless it's in my calendar.

# Gchat

In my opinion, <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/chat-is-the-best-way-to-interview-users/" target="_blank">chat is the best way to interview people</a>. I use gchat. It's not pretty or cool, but almost everybody has gchat.

# Evernote and Google Drive

Honestly I think they're both interchangable for me right now. I don't have enough documents to need any real advanced cloud storage, and I have no teammates to necessitate sharing. I use them to store notes.

# Changes to my tooling and workflow for the future

I'm still searching for a market gap to serve, and my workflow reflects this. My most important work involves speaking to people and learning from them. I'm not writing any code yet. If I need to churn out product development cycles, be ready to see another post sharing my updated workflow!
