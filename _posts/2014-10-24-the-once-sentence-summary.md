title: "The one-sentence summary"
---

The first major lesson I learned as a first-time entrepreneur is the importance of the one-sentence summary.

If you don't know what I mean by the one-sentence summary, I have a few quick examples.  <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/" target="_blank">Groove</a> is "simple help desk software."  <a href="https://www.getdrip.com/" target="_blank">Drip</a> is "lightweight marketing automation that doesn't suck."  <a href="http://www.mailcharts.com/" target="_blank">MailCharts</a> helps you "track and understand how your competitors use email marketing."  In two seconds, you understand how these companies want to help you.

When I first started speaking to potential customers, I didn't have a one-sentence summary because <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/whats-my-business-idea/" target="_blank">I didn't have a business idea</a>.  I can't have a summary if I don't have an idea to summarize.  I thought that was okay, too.

Now, I'm starting to feel otherwise.  I still believe having a market with plenty of problems is more important than the idea.  However, I learned that an idea, though maybe less important, is still mandatory for the sake of communicating to others.

Earlier this week, I spoke to a handful of potential customers.  I wanted to talk to them about their problems and how I might be able to solve them.  However, they would quickly get confused about how I could help them.  Rather than diving straight into explaining their problems, they would fish for my one-sentence summary.  They weren't very eager to just talk about their problems with me.  They wanted to know my plan to help them.  Any chat about their problems was very difficult if they didn't know my plan to help them.

Lesson learned: **it's easier for the seller to validate a market gap if the seller offers a simple idea, then allows the buyer to comment on it**.

It's only possible to communicate about your value proposition if you have a specific idea.  Potential users won't tell you exactly how you can help them, as I previously expected.  Rather, they want to hear your idea, then tell you yes or no.

I always knew a one-sentence summary was vital.  In my head, I thought it was only necessary when approaching the growth stage.  I was wrong.  It's necessary even when you're just trying to validate your idea and make sure it's worth building.

Now that I learned the importance of the one-sentence summary to even a founder barely starting up, one of my main priorities is to come up with a few specific value propositions.  My current method to position myself is unfavorable.  Time to adapt.
