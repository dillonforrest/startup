title: What's my business idea?
---

That's a good question.  At this moment, I don't know my business idea either.

That might sound ridiculous.  However, I actually have zero anxiety about having no business idea.

In the last two months, when I tell somebody that I'm quitting my job to start a company, the most common reply is, "What's your idea?"

The blunt truth is, I don't know.  But, my current bet is that I don't need to know.  I just need a market with plenty of problems which I am fit to solve.

The market which interests me most is nascent tech startups.  Unfortunately, that's too broad to be useful.  To find some viable customers, I'll have to further segment this demographic.  I need to be more specific.

To do that, I'll have to talk to potential clients and figure out their problems.

So, despite my lack of concrete business idea, I have a plan.  I need to talk to nascent tech startups and learn more about their problems.

More actionably, I decided to sign up for a hot desk at Wework Labs' [Soho West location](https://www.wework.com/locations/new-york-city/soho-west/).

November 1 is the earliest I can join Wework.  So, my first goal is to talk to thirty fledgling startups by November 15.  By that time, I want to have a good idea of a problem worth solving which I am fit to solve.

In lieu of a business idea, I have this plan.

It'd be nice to have a specific business idea, but it'd be even nicer to know that I have a plan to solve a real problem that people will pay me to solve.  The latter is all that matters for me to stay in business in the long-term.  Entrepreneurship is a long-term game.

Although I don't have a business idea, I still have a plan.  Remember, everybody: failing to plan is planning to fail.
