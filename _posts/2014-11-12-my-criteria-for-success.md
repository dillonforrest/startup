title: "My criteria for success"
---

To be blunt, the past few weeks have been rough.  The emotional highs and lows wear on me already, and I barely began.  I bet my entire career and years of savings on trying to start a company, and sometimes now I wonder if it's worth it.

The adversity and the ante are too substantial to not define my goals.  Here are my criteria for success.

# Learning to be an entrepreneur

It'd be great to be a resounding financial success the first time around.  Unfortunately, that's unlikely to happen.  The odds are against me.

Although I'll try my best, I don't expect to actually create a hit anytime soon.  I expect that my first few years will be filled with failure.  Failure is okay as long as I'm learning a ton along the way.

I've read that it takes as long as <a href="http://swombat.com/2011/10/14/three-years-business" target="_blank">three years</a> to start a successful business.  I'll be happy with just learning for now.

# Earning enough money to cover my living expenses

If I can cover my living expenses, then I can continue learning to be an entrepreneur.  This assumes that I will continue being a solo founder and will not hire any employees.

This also means that despite learning being more important than finances as stated above, I still need to make at least a little money.  Consulting part-time is always an option, but I hope to be able to cover my living expenses off of product sales rather than services.

# Having fun

Fun is the easiest way to keep people going over the long haul.  If entrepreneurship turns into the long-haul struggle that I'm anticipating, then I need to make sure I'm at least having the fun to fuel the journey.

A lot of this will come down to emotional resilience.  When there's good news, it's very exciting.  When there's bad news, holy shit it sucks.  But you need the bad, or else you'll know the good.  To have fun in the long-term, I need to be emotionally resilient and remember to have fun.

# Not allowing the venture to own me

I own the venture.  The venture does not own me.  If I'm proactive, I can make sure it stays that way.

The concept here is an abstract concept based off of *Fight Club*.  It may be too abstract for me to know how to put into more detail.  I think the general goal is to retain the ability to live my life mostly the way that I choose to live it.

Life has not been easy these days.  I'm holding my breath, being patient, and diligently trying to push myself to the unseen end of the tunnel.
