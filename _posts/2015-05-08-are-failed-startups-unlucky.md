title: "Are failed startups unlucky?"
---

A few months ago, I spoke with an old colleague of mine. Before we worked together, he worked on a few of his own startup attempts with varying degrees of success. One particular thing he said really suck out to me: "To succeed, you also need to be lucky. Nobody really talks about luck's role in a startup."

At first, I immediately agreed. I was struggling and frustrated, and saying I was unlucky was an easy coping mechanism. Many people who had failed startup attempts might consider their lack of luck to be a reason why they failed.

Luck also explained why sometimes seemingly untalented or unimpressive people can start reasonable startups. Plenty of us, myself included, wanted to start companies in part because we worked for startup CEOs who were dumb, and if they could do it, we can too, right?

Over time, as I started making more and more <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-9-biggest-mistakes-thus-far/" target="_blank">big mistakes</a>, I eventually realized that intellect and talent are only small parts of the equation, small enough that you can just not have them and still see more success than I did. That's not luck anymore. That's just having a more appropriate composition of skills and knowledge.

And of course, few successful startup founders will attribute their success to luck. Most humans are too self-serving and self-indulgent to say that. Modesty is a rare virtue these days.

Is my own <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/im-quitting-my-full-time-startup-efforts/" target="_blank">startup failure</a> due to lack of luck? I would say no. In fact, I have a hard time ascribing any failure in my life at all to lack of luck. Most people say "knowing my luck" to signal that they have bad luck. When I say "knowing my luck," I intend to signal the opposite. I consider myself extremely fortunate, to the point where sometimes I don't even appreciate my luck, and sometimes I expect it to be repeatable and reliable. I think I have a surplus of luck to spare.

If you prescribe to the equation where luck equals preparation plus opportunity, that means you can increase your luck by increasing your preparation and your exposure to opportunity. I can't say whether or not luck actually plays a role for a startup, but I'm currently betting my time and efforts on being more prepared and exposing myself to more opportunity.
