title: "Scale when you have something worth scaling"
---

Here's a Bill Gates quote that I shared once on my blog before but is worth repeating:

> The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.

You can swap "automation" for "scalability" and the quote is still equally true.

Popular startup wisdom suggests that early-stage startup founders "do things that don't scale." Like most startup wisdom today, this was made popular by <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a>.

I have a new view on scalability. Investing in scalability means betting on business operations. If the operation is efficient, then scaling that automation is good. If it's not efficient, then scaling it is bad. However, in the latter case, although it was ill-advised scalability, you can't just pull the plug and stop incurring its costs. You're much less mobile. Once you've invested cycles into scaling, you'll have a hard time going back.

This is my rationale for taking my time before searching for a ton of customers. I want to make sure I'm solving problems well. Only then will I have something worth scaling.
