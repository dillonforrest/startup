title: "Selling to risk averse vs. cost averse"
---

It's generally more attractive to sell to a risk-averse customer rather than a cost-averse customer. B2B's primary advantage over B2C is precisely the B2B customer's risk aversion in place of a B2C customer's cost aversion. Risk-averse customers spend more money.

There are two implications I wish I knew about selling to the risk averse vs the cost averse when it comes to enterprise software.

The first implication is that much less people will sell to the cost-averse. Everybody in enterprise software is chasing the risk-averse. That leaves hardly anybody left to serve the cost-averse. One of the most viable underserved customer segments will almost always be smaller, stingier companies. That means you'll need a much larger number of customers to grow your top line if average customer lifetime value is much lower. Be sure you'll have a distribution plan and a backup plan if you go this way.

I considered chasing after a cost-averse customer segment for my last project. It was pretty easy to cold email potential customers and find cost-averse customers who were still nonetheless excited to spend some money on my value proposition. However, I couldn't figure out a way to find enough of these customers to make it worth my while. I lacked distribution.

Among all companies chasing cost-averse, DigitalOcean is perhaps the very best example that I can think of right now.

The second implication is that cost-averse companies have few vendors from which to choose. The risk-averse are the rich companies. They can partner with more SaaS vendors to grow even more. The rich become richer. If you're a fledgling startup, you're probably cost-averse. The lack of budget-friendly options creates additional downward pressure, making it disproportionately difficult to grow and earn the luxury of risk aversion.

Having no budget sucks 100% of the time. In my startup attempt, I always wanted to try all these different tools to help me out. However, I was always far too cost-averse to give them my credit card number. So I stayed poor.

In any type of sales, figuring out whether your customer is risk-averse or cost-averse is a primary objective.
