People talk about the 80/20 pareto principle when they talk about being effective. I recently came across <a href="http://taylorpearson.me/8020principle/" target="_blank">this post</a> by Taylor Pearson discussing his 9 80/20 principles for entrepreneurship that he learned writing a book. He frequently references the book "Daily Rituals" to see how other creative workers be effective. Great post, Taylor!

I'd like to discuss these 9 principles and how I plan to handle each of them right now.

# 1. The first draft is hardest, so get it done asap

Quoting Taylor:

> Writing a book, like any creative project, is mainly a problem of definition. You start with this vague idea nebulously floating around in the ether, and the first draft forces you to condense that down into *something*.
>
> Even if that something is terrible, it’s take shape, it’s defined, and that’s a broad step forward. In retrospect, I’m still mildly embarrassed by how crummy the first draft I had alpha readers go through was, but getting something down on paper and then out of my head for feedback yielded a much better second draft.

The modern tech entrepreneur calls the first draft an MVP. The takeaway here is that entrepreneurs need to ship their first iteration as soon as possible. The first iteration is the hardest, but don't overdo it, because the second iteration is much easier.

I've done a good job with this so far. I've budgeted only till the <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/month-4-february-2015-wrapup/" target="_blank">end of March</a> to finish my prototype. It definitely won't be anything I'm super proud of at that time, but I expect it'll be enough of a first draft.

# 2. The 15 hour rule for creative work

Taylor:

> 15ish hours per week appears to be maximal high level creative output across domains and across time. It’s about what Stephen King gets. It’s what most all the authors, artists, and entrepreneurs in *Daily Rituals* were able to get.
>
>...I realized that all the writing I was doing above fifteen hours per week was creating creative work debt. I would spend the first five hours of my next week paying off that debt by editing and cutting the excess, then only getting five to ten hours of high quality writing done, be frustrated by the slow progress and then plow into creating more debt by logging another ten hours of debt inducing work, which I then promptly had to pay off the next week. Hello there negative spiral? Lovely to see you again.

Most of the other engineer-turned-entrepreneurs I know will go for 3 hour coding sessions 2 or 3 times a day, 5 to 7 days a week. I personally go for 3 a day Monday through Friday, and then I hope for 1 on Saturday and Sunday, but I never mind spending the weekends to recover completely.

I've been programming for long enough to know that you can't code productively if you try to code all day. You need time off. You'll accomplish more in the long run if you have good work/life balance rather than work nonstop.

Come April, I'll shoot for one 3 hour coding session a day. I'm skeptical that programming can only be done productively for 15 hours per week and expect the optimal number of hours to be 30. However, I need to start putting my work in front of potential customers. Frankly, I simply can't justify budgeting much more than 15 hours a week to code when I still have so much to learn about the market.

# 3. Have a routine

Taylor:

> Just as Amara’s Law leads us to overestimate technology in the short term and underestimate it in the long term, we often overestimate how much we can get done in a week or a month, yet dramatically underestimate how much we can get done in a year, five years, or a lifetime.
>
> By establishing rituals, we’re able to achieve prolific results with fifteen hours of work a week. Increasingly, I see rituals as the key to the “more output, less input” question.
>
> I’ve found my emphasis on ritual to be to closely correlated with my creative output: I do the same thing every single morning I plan to write.

I agree with this 100%. Several of my friends and I attempting to start up all discussed how we setup our daily routines.

Last week was an awful week precisely because my entire routine was blown apart. Some shenanigans out of my control led to me having to spend way too much time finding a new kitchen table on craigslist and hauling it back to my apartment to assemble. I spent way too much time worrying about shitty used ikea furniture and way too little time working on my prototype. But as I said, it was out of my control. I'm still very annoyed that those circumstances led to me wasting so much precious time and ruining all that work I could have done. Oh well. Sunk cost. Life happens.

Taylor's emphasis on routines helps me justify defending my own routine. I know last week sucked because my routine was thrown off, and I know now how much I can lose by having my routine thrown off again.

# 4. Ship projects regularly without overdeveloping them

Taylor:

> Shipping one project per year for ten years is going to end up producing a much better net output than spending ten years obsessing over a single project. I’ve read crappy first books and seen crappy first projects, but I’ve never seen a crappy tenth books or tenth project. I’m always inspired by reading early work from some of my favorite authors or seeing early projects from some of my favorite entrepreneurs. Have you ever read a blogger’s first post? They’re universally cringeworthy! I tried to re-read mine and almost vomited at all the cliches. The faster you can get to the tenth project, the better.

The tenth program that a programmer writes is better than the first. The tenth company a serial entrepreneur starts is better than the first.

I guess I'm technically in the middle of my first project. I'm not sure whether this particular principle is actionable for me in the short-run.

# 5. Avoid paralysis by analysis

Taylor:

> If you ever ask yourself, “Am I overthinking this?” the answer is always “yes,” and you’re into [diminishing] marginal returns. Once you’ve established you’re overthinking it, you either don’t have enough information to make a decision or the choice is arbitrary.

Fortunately, this hasn't happened to me yet. Somehow, an answer always presents itself to me. In the future, if I ever notice my progress haulting due to paralysis by analysis, I'll know what to do.

# 6. Start second drafts fresh, not off of the first draft

The gist of this principle is to start with a blank slate on new iterations. Quoting Taylor:

> Starting a new file let me move around sections without any sunk cost nagging at me and not copy over some sections were weak or not relevant, and the book is better for it.

As a programmer, I loved seeing this. The tech industry has a general aversion to rewriting large pieces of software. Project managers vastly prefer refactoring and fixing existing codebases over writing new ones to replace them. I always thought that was stupid. Anecdotally, I know I can write software to derive the same or even more business value much more quickly than fixing existing shitty software.

# 7. Delegate non-essential tasks to others

Taylor:

> One thing that stood out to me in the book is that all of the people had individuals in their lives that helped them manage side activities to focus on their work.
>
> Almost everyone in Daily Rituals had someone that helped them. For Freud, it was his wife Martha, who “laid out Freud’s clothes, chose his handkerchiefs, and even put toothpaste on his toothbrush—the founder of psychoanalysis was able to maintain a single-minded devotion to his work throughout his long career.”
>
> Having an assistant come in and help me out with the formatting and other admin and marketing work so I could focus on the writing created visibility and leverage.
>
> Getting an editor was also something I put off for years, and has given me tremendous leverage. Editing is something that cuts into my fifteen hours so anything that lets me buy back a section of those hours is a no-brainer.
>
> There’s no money (or fun) in martyrdom.

Although I'm trying to keep my expenses to a minimum, they're not at low as they could be. I still spend money to get my laundry picked up, washed, dried, folded, and delivered back to me. Laundry is so cheap that it makes no sense not to. Although I don't call my house cleaner as often as I used to, I still would prefer to bring in a cleaner for my apartment than clean myself. Laundry and cleaning are both use blocks of time which would cut into my ability to focus on what matters more.

# 8. Take walks

Taylor:

> There seems to be something about walking which promotes creativity. I don’t know what the mechanism is, but the phenomenology of it is abundantly clear.
>
> The word “walk” appeared ninety-eight times in Daily Rituals.
>
> Steve Jobs was well known for his walking meetings and Nietzsche claimed that the idea which inspired the Ubermensch, his most well-known concept, came to him during a walk in the Swiss Alps.

Okay, walking is really not for me. I don't do this. Although I go to the gym four days a week, I don't actually walk to get my creative juices flowing. When I need a break, I usually cook or wash dishes. I'm trying to get in the habit of vacuuming or cleaning my bathroom when I need a break too. Maybe I should try walking as well.

# 9. Bake marketing into your project's output

Taylor shared a quote by <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2015/01/5-reasons-your-book-will-fail/" target="_blank">Ryan Holiday</a>:

> Writing is marketing, you need to realize. Too many books fail because it was written in a vacuum, without ever considering anything beyond your own immediate tastes and needs. You wrote without ever thinking: How the hell are people going to hear about this and why would they care if they do?

Ryan is referencing two classic antipatterns among entrepreneurs: building something nobody wants, and building something nobody will ever know about.

Taylor breaks down this principle into a few key concepts. The first concept is that the best marketing is simply word of mouth marketing. Your product needs to be so good that your customers can't not talk about it to their friends. In the long run, products that simply aren't that good just won't succeed. I remember hearing YCombinator partner Kevin Hart say that he believes a marketing spend is a tax for not having a sufficiently great product, since sufficiently great products should sell themselves. Kevin's thought itself makes sense, but it's an exaggeration. The greats need that marketing effort to make themselves known first, and then their output's intrinsic value should carry them the rest of the way.

The second concept is to find ways to both expand your reach and build relationships with customers while you develop your product. Taylor listed a few tactics specific for writers. I'm wondering what I can do with my current prototype to accomplish the same result.

# My takeaways

The principles that I'm already following are shipping the first draft asap, having a routine, starting second drafts fresh, delegating non-essential tasks, 

The principles I'm not following are the 15 hour rule for creative work, walking, and baking in the marketing. Currently I still feel productive coding much more than 15 hours a week, even though I'll be coding less starting April 1 to talk to the market more. I don't really know if I'll start walking, but would expect that I probably won't.

Baking in the marketing? Marketing is the most critical question to answer. Most tech startups these days succeed on good marketing, not good software.
