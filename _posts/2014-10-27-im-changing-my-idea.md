title: "I'm changing my idea"
---

Last week was my first week of working full-time on my startup attempt.  I spoke with several people about a general space which interests me, making web applications easier for non-technical founders.  However, after speaking with both prospective clients and other friends, I decided that it wasn't worth pursuing.

So, I'm changing my idea.  Rather than helping non-technical founders, I will try to help developers.  My new idea to validate will be whether developers are interested in a tool to turn their design sketches into professional HTML & CSS.

## Scratching your own itch

Startup people frequently advocate creating products to solve your own problems.  They sometimes call it "scratching your own itch".  My recent idea is nice because it's scratching my own itch.  As a developer, I'd absolutely love this tool.

Scratching your own itch has several advantages.

One, you already know there's at least some sort of market for your idea.  The market size is at least one: yourself.

Two, you are more atuned to your customers.  You have shared your customers' pain points.  You are your own customer.  This is a huge advantage, since the startup founder's primary job should be to understand the startup's customers.

Three, you're more likely to be passionate about this problem.  Startups are an arduous process.  Passion fuels you through the slog.

I'm certain not all companies are started by entrepreneurs scratching their own itches.  In fact, I'd expect that most founders create companies not because they're scratching their own itch, but despite not scratching their own itch.  In the end, you're stacking the cards more in your favor if you build a company which scratches your own itch.

## Pursuing multiple ideas

This week, I still have appointments to meet with non-technical founders.  Although I won't pursue any product ideas with that demographic anymore, I think it's a bad idea to cancel these appointments.  Some of my previous talks with non-technical founders showed some willingness to pay for other types of smaller services.  So, I came up with a few simple service ideas which I'll discuss with my upcoming appointments.

Diversification is generally acknowledged to be good.  When validating a business idea, if you can diversify your efforts and try to validate several ideas at once, that's probably also good.

Although the goal is ultimately to create a product business, I still have no cashflows.  I'm happy to provide a simple service to others to bring some revenue while also validating product ideas.

## Smaller ideas lead to specific plans

Immediately after changing ideas from a vague one to a specific one, I realized a great benefit.  My plans suddenly were much more obvious.

Difficulty in planning is expensive.  I'm incentivized to keep moving forward every day.  Each day I live without revenue is another day of expenses down the drain.  If planning is difficult, then each day is spent less productively.  If planning is easy, then it's much easier to move myself in a direction to eventually realize revenues.

Smaller ideas means specific planning, which means more money sooner.

## The downside of having a cofounder

The startup community is full of diverse and conflicting opinions, but one of the most prevalent and agreed-upon opinions is that having a cofounder (or two) is good.

I said "fuck it" and started up solo.  My goal is to work by myself, without a cofounder or any employees.  This is mostly due to my nature.  I just enjoy working by myself and, being employed at companies with coworkers for so long, have missed working alone.  A second reason is that I want to be as flexible as possible in the beginning.

The downside of having a cofounder is that you still need to have at least one person agree with you before making drastic changes.

I can change my idea without any warning.  I'm a solo entrepreneur.  I can do things like this every hour of every day.  If I had a cofounder, the process for drastic changes is automatically an order of magnitude slower.

I like the idea of a cofounder for anything but a super early stage venture like my own.  If I have market validation for an idea, then a cofounder makes sense.  Till then, I'd prefer to be solo.
