title: "Labeling yourself as a competitor"
---

This month was mostly dedicated to customer development. I split tested two different approaches: labeling myself as a competitor and not mentioning any potential competitors.

# Competitors are good

Let's get this point out of the way first. Competitors are good. Competition means it's a valid market. It means people are already paying money for this value proposition. If you want to enter an existing market, all you need is to make your own value proposition unique enough to stand out and attract an underserved market segment.

"Competitor" is an elastic word depending on scope. If you zoom in enough on customer segments, specific value propositions, and branding, you can argue that no single company has any competitors. If you zoom out enough, you can argue that every company competes with every other company.

I've come to believe that your broad market should have competitors, but your niche market should not. You should strive for opportunities to monopolize your tiny market. If there's no opportunity to be a monopoly, you probably have too many competitors. If people immediately recognize why you're different from everybody else in the market, you have the optimal type of competition: they're validating your market, but staying out of your niche.

# The advantages of labeling yourself as a competitor

Although I didn't consider myself a true competitor to any existing company, I thought it was worth experimenting with labeling myself as a competitor anyway. The biggest advantage to this is that it's easy to communicate your value proposition. If anything, you can steal your competitors' copy and then put a spin on it to address your niche.

Turns out that this is the only advantage of labeling yourself as a competitor.

# The disadvantages of labeling yourself as a competitor

The first disadvantage is that you provide free marketing to your competitors. I wanted to talk to one of my friends about my value proposition, but when I mentioned my competitor, he googled them and signed up immediately. That really sucked at the time. However, if this happens to you, know that awareness is not a sustainable competitive advantage in SaaS.

The second disadvantage is that you might make people uncomfortable. I spoke with some people who were already loyal to my competitors. I didn't know that at the time, but I found out eventually that maybe they were already customers for my competitors, or maybe they were even friends. They didn't like my angle positioning myself as a competitor for their friends. For my competitors' loyalists with whom I did NOT phrase myself as a competitor, I was able to have extremely productive and fun conversations. If I had labeled myself as as competitor to everybody rather than just a test group of contacts, the number of productive conversations I would have had would be zero.

The third disadvantage is that you start mentally anchoring your product roadmap onto your competitors. You start thinking that you have to become a mini version of them. This is bad because it gives you a myopia which prevents you from seeking out only feedback from the only people who matter, your customers.

# The prescription

Yes, you should have competitors. No, they should not be any competitors in your niche. No, you shouldn't ever label yourself as a competitor.
