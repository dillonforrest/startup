title: How to fund your startup
---

In my view, there are three main ways to fund your startup venture.

The most well-known way is venture capital.  This includes sexy news-worthy events like angel investments and Series A rounds.  Venture capital involves trading away ownership stakes in your startup to investors for cash from the investors.

The next way is loans.  The structure of the loan can vary.  The general idea is that somebody gives you money, and you have to pay back the money eventually, plus interest.

The last way is bootstrapping.  Bootstrapping means funding your startup with your own cash.  You don't take on cash from investors.  You don't take on debt.  You simply use your own resources to pay your bills while working on your startup.

Although I present these three ways together, they're not at all equal.

According to Brian Wang during an episode of <a href="http://www.foundersgambit.com/" target="_blank">Founders Gambit</a>, a startup is statistically unlikely to successfully raise money from investors <a href="http://youtu.be/s6Go-50La5Q?t=32m20s" target="_blank">(source)</a>.  Both venture capital and loans will involve convincing others to give you money.  And you might not even succeed.

## Why I'm choosing to bootstrap

Unlike the other two ways, bootstrapping does not require a sales show.  It's the simplest way to fund your own startup.  I like simple, so I like the idea of bootstrapping.

Bootstrapping might seem riskier because failure and running out of money suddenly feels more tangible, more probable.  I'm not sure if bootstrapped companies empirically are more or less likely to succeed than funded companies.  However, I actually like the extra pressure of failure.  It forces me to cut out the bullshit and start thinking about making real money sooner.

Some people like to have a healthy cushion.  Right now, I'm opting for a fire under my ass.  Bootstrapping is my fire.
