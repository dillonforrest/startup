title: "If I could redo my startup preparation"

I've been trying to start a company for three months now. In hindsight, there are a few key things I'd do differently to prepare to start up.

# I'd leave my soul-sucking job to find another job, not immediately start up

The timing for me starting up was mostly dictated by how much I hated my last job. I've known since college that I wanted to try starting my own company, but my last job accelerated those plans by at least four years.

I hated my job so much that I felt zero vitality in any other areas of my life. It was impossible to be productive. It was impossible to fathom employment at all. I had to leave.

I ended up staying one full year so I could buy my stock options. Although I'm glad I have the options, in retrospect, I wouldn't have waited. I would have left the moment I realized the job wasn't worth my time or my compensation and found a better job instead. I basically wasted five months waiting for my equity to vest. At the time, I figured I could just draw five more months' salary and enjoy some more time with my friends at work and then finally pick up my stock options. Those five months crawled like molasses. In retrospect, I think I'd rather have just saved those five months plus the cost of the options rather than draw five more months of below-market comp and receive stock options.

If I would have left, I would have probably preferred to find a better place to work rather than start up right away. There were more software problems that I wanted to solve before starting up. That would have been a great opportunity to not just amass more savings but also actually learn and grow.

# I'd validate a business idea before quitting my job.

I originally started up with no set <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/whats-my-business-idea/" target="_blank">business idea</a>. I don't think that's a bad idea necessarily, but it's also unnecessary.

The nature of validating business ideas is 100% asynchronous. You reach out to people with a value proposition. They might eventually reply with some feedback. There's so much waiting involved. This waiting can be done while you're on a salary. While working for somebody else, I would use my extra energy to validate ideas.

This is why I said above that I'd leave soul-sucking jobs to find a new job. If your job exhausts all your vitality and you can't seem to be productive outside of work, then you won't even have the energy to do the crazy amounts of sourcing prospects and reaching out to validate any business ideas.

# Not everything is awesome

I don't mind the way I <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/how-i-prepared-to-start-up/" target="_blank">prepared to start up</a>. I think it could have been better, but I'm glad I eventually did.

The key takeaway that I want my readers to know is that validating business ideas, in my experience so far, has been so asynchronous that there's no reason you can't do it while you're salaried, unless your job sucks and constantly makes you angry and tired.

Better ideas come from hindsight, but we live in the present. Let's move onward.
