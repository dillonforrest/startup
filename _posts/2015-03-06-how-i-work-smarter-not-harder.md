title: "How I work smarter, not harder"
---

Starting a company has required more <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/sources-of-motivation/" target="_blank">hard work</a> and <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/being-persistent-vs-being-annoying/" target="_blank">persistence</a> than I'd ever exerted before. But maybe more important than working hard is working smart.

Don't chase your tail running in circles. Be effective with your hard work. Here's how I try to work smarter.

# Neverending communication with the market

Previously, I thought I'd spend about <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/book-review-traction/" target="_blank">half</a> of my time talking to the market. I changed my plans since then. Now, I'm rushing to build a prototype before spending more time talking to target customers. I spend almost 100% of my time building.

However, it's important not to completely fall into the comfort of your text editor. While I think I should be spending most of my time coding, I shouldn't be completely shut off from the market.

I have some friends in the space that I'd like to enter. I should be trying to talk to them about my idea. Even spending 15 minutes a week talking to the market is immensely preferable to zero.

# Disregard most advice

One of the crazy things about trying to start up is the amount of advice that you'll receive. You probably only asked for a slice of the advice actually received. Most of this advice is, unfortunately, bad advice.

The best advice comes from entrepreneurs who have solved similar problems. They might've been in the same industry that you're trying to enter.  Maybe they've served customers with a similar profile as your target customers. Maybe they were upstream or downstream in the same value chain. One personal example for me was listening to advice from B2B entrepreneurs about <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/preselling-to-enterprise-customers/" target="_blank">preselling to enterprise customers</a>. B2C entrepreneurs and B2C advice seems to be ubiquitous at times. You can find B2C content anywhere. Unfortunately their advice for market validation is sometimes pretty bad advice. Whatever your problem space, give 10x more weight to advice from entrepreneurs who have worked on similar problems.

The second best source good advice comes from the market, your customers. You might be surprised that I listed this as second best rather than first, but please be patient and hear me out. Customers feedback is the most important feedback out there, but I'd be going to them for specifically feedback, not advice. Customers will give you critical feedback, but you'll still have to do all the work to decipher it into actual advice. The advice mentioned above, from entrepreneurs who worked on similar problems, doesn't need any deciphering. Customer feedback doesn't become customer advice until you think about things a bit more. Even customer feedback in the form of advice shouldn't be taken as advice. You're the entrepreneur, so you're the one who decides what the takeaway is.

The third best source of advice is VCs. If you're fortunate to have friends in VC, you should totally talk to them when you're trying to start up. The good thing about VCs is that they see so many startups in a much smaller amount of time. Additionally, they're highly connected. You can probably meet some helpful people from them. The downside of VCs is that they're VCs, not entrepreneurs. Many of them used to be entrepreneurs, but there's a nuanced difference in interests. VCs diversify their portfolio and will deploy their capital to dozens of different companies. They only need one to become huge for them to make money. You, as an entrepreneur, do not have the luxury of deploying all your resources into a diversified portfolio. You are probably going all-in on one particular idea at any given time. While this difference in interests probably won't lead to much bad advice, I'd still keep this in mind to understand the context of any advice I get from VCs.

Advice from everybody else can probably be ignored. Lots of people are enthustiastic about entrepreneurship and startups, but don't conflate their enthusiasm or their confidence with credibility. They're advice has poor signal to noise.

# Stay optimistic

This one is simple. Stay away from those <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/all-about-haters/" target="_blank">haters</a>. Haters will get you down. When you're optimistic, you're productive. When you're pessimistic, you're not.

I actively try to avoid sources of pessimism and negativity now. I avoid conversations about startups with people who've discouraged me in the past. I disengage and immediately stop talking about startups with people who don't have anything productive to say.

Entrepreneurship requires being <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/entrepreneurship-requires-being-weirdly-optimistic/" target="_blank">weirdly optimistic</a>. That optimism is not just for your sanity, but also for your productivity.
