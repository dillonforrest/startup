title: "Validating enterprise business ideas the wrong way"
---

Popular startup wisdom encourages you validate a problem before investing any time to build and offer a solution. I would conjecture that most well-read startup enthusiasts are well-aware of the idea of selling before building.

# Generic problem validation advice is just generic

Everybody recommends entrepreneurs go out and talk to people about their problems, everybody from lean startup book authors to legitimate entrepreneurs with their own skin in the game to the average wantrepreneur.

They all make it sound so easy to validate problems, but it's not easy. It's a long, arduous process. I wrote a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/convincing-business-owners-to-talk-to-me/" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-cant-make-money-from-local-small-businesses/" target="_blank">posts</a> about my difficulties talking to people about their problems. I had no idea that validating problems would be so tough.

The reason why it's so hard is that nobody wanted to talk to me. Only a handful of people wanted to set aside the time to talk with me about their problems. Several times I was able to validate a problem in the SMB space, but I would have to contact at least 50 companies before 1 person would reply.

I think the plain advice "just talk to people about their problems" is effective for consumer and maybe 1- or 2-person companies. They're much more likely to make time to talk to you. But, in my experience thus far, SMB and enterprise problems can't be so simply validated. Talking to you is not an acceptable block in their calendar.

Very few people at existing companies are willing to talk to you about their problems, especially when you're a random unknown person trying to start your first company like myself. Generic startup advice won't help you validate problems that SMB or enterprise customers have.

# SMB and enterprise customers value their time too much

I wanted to meet some colleagues of one of my more experienced friends. My goal was, of course, validating a problem. He later told me that his friends didn't want to talk to me just to validate a problem for me. They only wanted to talk to me if I had a solution, if there was some way that they might benefit from sharing their time with me.

My buddy went on to tell me that his friends were constantly complaining about the same problem. However, despite how much annoyance the problem causes, they still didn't want to talk with me. They considered themselves and their time beyond me, since they've "made it" and their time is worth $X00/hour.

# Divorcing validating the problem with validating the solution

When you come across people who say "talk to people about their problems," it's almost always in the context of validating business ideas. A business idea is a proposed solution in the context of a problem.

Unfortunately, only normal people, employed or maybe an entrepreneur with a cofounder and no employees, will actually want to have a conversation with you. If you want to validate a problem for SMB or enterprise segments, you might have to settle with finding out that they're complaining about the problem. Or, better yet, they're investing their own resources into building a solution to solve the problem for themselves. You won't get them on the phone. You won't be able to talk to them as the startup bandwagon says they will. You might not be able to validate the proposed solution, but you can still observe actions to validate the problem.

I'm realizing now that "talking to people about their problems" is unnecessary for simple validation. Talking to people is probably important to validate solutions, but it's a luxury for validating problems.

# A lesson that costed me $5,000 USD

I learned this lesson on Friday afternoon last week. Up to that point, I had spent roughly $5,000 USD on living expenses over three months in New York City to try to start up. All of my time was spent validating business ideas, with a heavy emphasis on SMB customers. I knew I was struggling and I knew validating problems was more difficult than people made it sound. I didn't know why people just didn't want to talk to me. But now I think I finally know why. It's my most expensive lesson to date.

I still have a lot to learn, but today I am confident discouraging "talking to your users" to validate a problem if you're targeting larger customers. You might have to look for other cues for validation. However, validating a solution with SMB and enterprise customers is still something I'm not sure of. One thing I know for sure, they won't just make time to talk to me the way everybody says they will.

Anybody who makes it sound simple and straightforward hasn't done it themselves, and that's why they think it's simple and straightforward.
