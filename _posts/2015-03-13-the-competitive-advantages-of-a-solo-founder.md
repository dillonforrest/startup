title: "The competitive advantages of a solo founder"
---

I decided to try to start up <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-value-of-a-cofounder/" target="_blank">alone</a>. I wanted the autonomy to do things exactly the way I wanted, without the buy-in of even a cofounder. Now that I've been going about it longer, I'm much more openminded to getting a cofounder, but I'm mostly happy still being solo.

Here are the competitive advantages that I hope to leverage as a solo founder in the very near future.

# Stronger technology

Today, most web companies which are considered progressive use javascript in the front with ruby or python in the back, persisting their data with mysql or postgres. Some web companies use even older technology, java or php. Yes, there are strong applications and software written in java or php, but that's only a handful of companies choosing java or php among a sea full of companies drowning in poor abstractions. Their software is strong because of their strong engineers and in spite of their tech stack, not because of their tech stack.

One of Paul Graham's original essays is how he beat <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">his competition</a> using lisp while his competitors used Perl or C++. Everybody listens to his startup advice, but nobody listens to his software advice. Paul and YCombinator fund huge numbers of companies which still continue to use commonplace languages with substantial known warts.

There is stronger technology out there. Most companies are just too risk-averse to use them. They want to minimize risk, not cost, so therefore they'll stick with their shitty abstractions and continue slinging java and php.

As a solo founder, I have the luxury of choosing my own tech stack. There are plenty of stronger options out there, but I decided to go with clojurescript in the front, clojure and datomic in the back. Programmers who know me in person won't be surprised about that. My hope is that choosing stronger languages will help me level the playing field where everybody else has a team of engineers who don't spend any time selling or marketing.

# Open source (almost) everything

Former Github CEO Tim Preston-Werner encourages companies to <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html" target="_blank">open source (almost) everything</a>. CodeCombat cofounder Nick Winter also advocates <a href="http://blog.codecombat.com/why-you-should-open-source-your-startup" target="_blank">open sourcing your startup</a>.

I'm not sure yet how much I'll choose to open source. I'm a solo founder though, so I can choose to open source whatever I want.

Simply flipping the switch to turn your repo from private to public probably isn't enough to reap the business value of open sourcing your software. I'm sure there's a right and wrong way to do it. Simply having a very real option to do so is exciting though. Like Nick says, open source is something that almost all other companies avoid. If done correctly, it can be a massive competitive advantage.

# Being a human being, not a robot

I got some amazing advice from Fred Lee, EVP Engineering at <a href="https://www.bellycard.com/" target="_blank">Belly</a>. Among his insights was the suggestion to choose about 5 values which not only define me as a person but make me unique among everybody else.

To clarify, a value is not something generic and predictable like "integrity" or "excellence." That's dreadfully boring. Fred gave a few examples of Belly's values, such as "give a shit" (purposely worded this way, said Fred) and "relentless to improve." A value is something which you believe is so strongly the correct thing to do, and it uniquely identifies you to the point where your friends would describe you by those values.

The business value in choosing these values is enabling you to hire likeminded people and work with likeminded partners and customers. When everybody is likeminded, everybody is happier. Conflicting values means conflicting people. Longlasting conflict is certainly expensive and certainly not a competitive advantage.

One value that I chose for myself is "be a human being, not a robot." My friends and previous colleagues all knew me as the guy who used way too many exclamation points and emoticons in my emails. Really, that's just the way I like to operate. I'm a human being, and I like to make other people feel like human beings. I despise talking to drones and robots. I despise boring so-called "professional" language.

Being a solo founder, I can choose how to present myself to target customers. Will I be yet another robot? Of course not. I can be a real human being, exclamation marks and emoticons galore.

# Less expenses

Living as a struggling entrepreneur is <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/struggling-founders-lifestyle/" target="_blank">very difficult</a>. Thankfully, there's a glass-half-full perspective too. You, as a solo founder, are only one person, and you only have one person's expenses.

Having cofounders and employees means paying salaries. Suddenly, a ton of interesting gambles and decisions are no longer practical for you. You are forced to become more risk-averse.

As a solo founder, you can choose to do almost anything as long as you can cover your living expenses. The only thing holding you back is your ability to execute.

# Not everything is terrible

I can't count the number of times that people have told me to look for a cofounder. Although I'm openminded to it, I don't need it. In my attempt to remain <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/entrepreneurship-requires-being-weirdly-optimistic/" target="_blank">weirdly optimistic</a>, I'll ignore the naysayers and continue persevering.
