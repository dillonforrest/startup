title: "How I focus and stay productive"
---

I noticed that many of my friends who were also working on nascent startup attempts had a very difficult time focusing and being productive. Being 100% in charge of your own schedule is a drastic change, and it wasn't easy for me to figure out how to avoid distractions after that. I'd like to share with you my best methods for focusing while I was hacking on my startup.

# Say "no" to your friends

This is important. You just can't hang out with your friends as much anymore. Start saying no to them.

During my startup attempt, I essentially fell off the map. I didn't see many of my friends for months at a time. Usually I was either too busy or too tired to go out and be social anyway.

Being less social also helps to save money. While it sucks to not see your friends, it's also super helpful to save time, attention, and money and invest them in your startup attempt instead.

# Find a routine

One of Taylor Pearson's <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/more-output-less-input/" target="_blank">nine 80/20 habits</a> for entrepreneurs is to find a routine. Falling into a routine means delegating focus to habit rather than active willpower.

It took me a little over a month before I found a routine that worked for me. After that, my body was on autopilot. Sleep, gym, cook, eat, work, eat, work, and then back to sleep. My body knew subconsciously when and how to focus when I needed to. This was no longer an effort for me to be productive. My routine made productivity easy.

# Take breaks

On weekends, I usually worked either not at all or a few hours at most. Otherwise, I took my weekends pretty seriously and rested. Every Monday, I was ready to attack my week again.

I usually slept without an alarm. I'd let my body rest as much as it needed to. Typically the only reason I set it was if I made an appointment to talk to a potential customer.

I worked out 4-5 days a week. Working out is extremely cathartic to me. I think exercise is actually better for your brain than your body.

While working, if I needed a break, I'd usually cook some food. After an hour or two of cooking and eating, I'd be ready to get back to work.

# Find ways to be accountable

You want to measure your progress. No progress means no productivity.

The main way I stayed accountable was by talking with my girlfriend. I told her literally everything that ran through my brain. I was a solo founder who wanted to stay solo, but having somebody else to talk to was always helpful for me still.

I also used <a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a> to keep track of my accomplishments iDoneThis has a handy feature where they email you to show you your accomplishments from a few weeks or even a few months ago. Oftentimes I felt I wasn't accomplishing much, but my iDoneThis emails would show me how far I'd come in a short amount of time. This is good not just to track my productivity but also to boost my morale.

The last way I stayed accountable was with my blog. I have an audience which would be considered tiny and insignificant to most publishers, but to me is substantial and motivating. Enforcing a cadence of three posts per week meant I was always queueing post ideas and analyzing my journey. The constant queueing and analyzing encouraged me to be more and more productive to feed higher quality content into my blog.

# Your answers aren't the same as mine

I'm not sure what will work for everybody else. These are what worked for me. Entrepreneurship is hard because it's mostly a journey of learning. Your first plan is never the last plan. You have to experiment and see what works for yourself.
