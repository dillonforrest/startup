It's hard to believe it's only been three months now since I've begun my journey. So much has happened in such a short amount of time.

# Completed

#### Shipped a smaller product, a chatroom for entrepreneurs

This was the smaller of my two projects going into last month. I quickly got my <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-first-commitments-to-pay/" target="_blank">first commitments for payment</a>.

I don't think I'll end up charging any money for it though. Plainly put, I don't care about it enough. I don't think I'll put in the effort to make it worth the money for my customers. However, I think it continues to add small amounts of value for some people in the room, and I'm happy with that.

#### Explored some MVP wireframes

The larger of my two projects going into this month was a tool to help web development agencies scope their proposals faster.

I spent a lot of time and effort doing my due diligence on this market. It seemed lucrative enough to cover my rent with just one or two customers. However, I struggled to create a simple solution for the problem. The whole point of the tool is to save time for the customers. However, the tool requires a huge time investment from the customers before it starts saving time. I've talked to enough B2B customers to know that a solution that works out of the box, a plug-and-play product requiring no setup time, is immensely more valuable than one requiring any meaningful time investment to setup. The amount of time that my solution would require far exceeded anything reasonable.

I ended up designing some minimum viable product wireframes and am currently discussing them with my friend who runs an agency, who might be my first customer if the MVP is greenlit.

# In Progress

#### Resolve the proposal scoping project

My expectation is that this project has come to an end. I'm not sure yet though, as it depends on my friend's thoughts about investing even more of his scarce time before finally saving time. I'm not an agency owner myself, so I can't give an informed estimation. If he thinks it's worth it, then great, and I think we'll continue moving forward, otherwise this project will be over. Either way, we need to reach a resolution, and I need to start thinking about my next project just in case.

# Things I did well

Did I do anything well this month?

Honestly, I don't think so. This month sucked. Good riddance.

# Things I learned

#### Persistence is more important than anything

Entrepreneurship is not easy, especially if you're an <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/introversion-and-entrepreneurship-dont-mix/" target="_blank">introvert</a>. You need to continually persist and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Even if you're afraid of <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/being-persistent-vs-being-annoying/" target="_blank">being annoying</a>, you must continue to persist.

#### Most conventional startup wisdom is aimed at consumer companies

The most trite startup wisdom states that you should talk to your users to validate problems before coding. This is all nice and dandy, but it's only a luxury that exists in consumer. I learned that it's <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/if-i-could-redo-my-startup-preparation/" target="_blank">almost impossible</a> to do that in SMB and enterprise domains.

I seriously doubt you can build a huge email list of SMBs interested in your solution, the same way that lean startup preachers validate their own ideas with hundreds of email signups with no product. B2B customers are a different animal.

There is one exception: companies consisting of only the founders. One- and two-person companies behave basically as normal consumers. Normal startup wisdom applies to them as well.

#### I like SMB and enterprise problems

I'm not entirely certain why, but consumer problems and products are just not interesting to me.

Part of it is because I think B2B is harder. Another part is because B2B has higher earning potential per customer. Another part is because B2B seems so much more unknown, and I want to explore the unknown.

There's more behind my pull to B2B, but I can't put my finger on all of it. I'm going to commit to B2B problems for a bit longer to see where that pans out.

# Goals for next month

#### Validate problems synchronously

My reader <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/validating-enterprise-business-ideas-the-wrong-way/#comment-1819252651" target="_blank">Cesc Vilanova</a> shared with me the idea of Amy Hoy's "Sales Safari." Amy has strong thoughts running parallel with my own doubts on the efficacy of talking to people about their problems. But to me, the most valuable part of Amy's input is that she has a mostly synchronous method to validate problems. I used to think that validating problems was <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/if-i-could-redo-my-startup-preparation/" target="_blank">100% asynchronous</a>, but now I realize that doesn't have to be true. Asynchronous is expensive, so I hope to avoid that for next month and attempt to run things synchronously as much as possible.

#### Earn commitments to pay for a new solution

All my other monthly wrapups said that my goal for next month was to make money. This month, I want to be more relaxed about that. I just want to isolate problems, and then propose solutions which will earn commitments to pay.

# Numbers

Revenue: $0

I think I could have earned a little over $100 for my chatroom. However, I already know that I would have ended up having to refund it anyway for the chatroom monetization experiment being a failure.

At the beginning of last month, I was very anxious to be earning money by today. That didn't happen. But I think that's okay. This month, I learned important and influential lessons to keep me going.
