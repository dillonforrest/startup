title: "My biggest expenses so far"
---

Starting up is an endurance race. The less you can spend, the longer you can race. Unfortunately for me, I've had a few big expenses.

# Rent

I live in Hell's Kitchen in New York City. My current rent is a good deal for the neighborhood and my space. However, it's by far my biggest expense.

I contemplated moving out to a cheaper location. However, I wanted to stay in New York, I still wanted to be somewhat comfortable, and I didn't want to commute an hour each way into the city. I didn't think the time and money required to find a new apartment and move was worth the possible savings from the new apartment.

For some reason, it never crossed my mind to live in New Jersey. My buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule" target="_blank">Sam DeBrule</a>, who runs <a href="https://www.moretempo.com" target="_blank">Tempo</a>, shares an apartment in Jersey City with his cofounder, and he says his commute into the city is within 20-30 minutes. That's a much better commute than Queens or Brooklyn!

I like my apartment and would have a hard time moving out of it. However, if money becomes a very serious issue, I will consider moving to Jersey City too.

# Stock options

When I left my last company, I bought my stock options. This ended up costing a little more than one month's rent.

I'm glad I have the stock options now, but in retrospect, I think it was a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/if-i-could-redo-my-startup-preparation/" target="_blank">bad idea</a> for me to stay my full year to be eligible to buy them. Maybe the options will be worth something meaningful one day. But right now, I think I'd probably prefer that money back in my bank account to give me another month.

# Coworking space membership

I signed up to join <a href="https://www.wework.com/" target="_blank">Wework</a>, a coworking space. I thought it'd be a great way to make more friends and have a community as I attempted to start up. I also imagined that I might be able to get easier distribution for any ideas to help small companies, which would more than pay for the membership fee.

Unfortunately, this turned out to be a complete waste of money for me. I had a very difficult time meeting people at Wework. I was not able to get any distribution for any ideas while I was there. Worst, I found it completely inconvenient to leave my apartment to work at Wework. I ended up just working consistently on my kitchen table.

Wework was a bad idea. I got literally zero benefit out of my Wework membership, and I wish I didn't join in the first place. If you're set on being a solo entrepreneur like myself, I would not recommend joining a coworking space. It's only worthwhile if you have a team.

# Not everything is expensive

Although New York has a reputation for being expensive, I've managed to keep my expenses relatively in control. The big win is not going out. Food and drinks don't cost a lot individually, but if you go out to eat and drink every day, you'll be broke before you know it. I forced myself to learn to <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/saving-money-on-food/" target="_blank">cook</a>. It's paid off so far. And of course, no new clothes, no vacations, no cabs.

Despite my rent and some of my other big expenses, I'm optimistic about my spending and my runway still. There are some mistakes I can afford to make as long as I make those mistakes only one time. Fool me twice, shame on me.
