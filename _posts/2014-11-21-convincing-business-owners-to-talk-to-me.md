title: "Convincing business owners to talk to me"
---

Conventional startup wisdom says that you should understand your customers as well as possible.  Even just finding meaningful market gaps to serve is a result of knowing your future customers.  A successful product is one which solves the problems of its customers.  A successful founder is one who understands the problems of the customers.

My interest is serving small business owners.  My goal, therefore, is to understand small business owners as best as I can.

# My poor attempts to contact potential customers

Earlier this week, I set a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-was-setting-goals-like-an-idiot/" target="_blank">goal</a> to talk to 20 small businesses about their problems.  I didn't necessarily consider all 20 to be potential customers, but I did believe that their input would be helpful.

I contacted 20 different companies.  I only ended up speaking with a quarter of them.  Most of them haven't gotten back to me yet.

I definitely failed my week's goal.

# My first approach was bad

My poor response rate means I'm having a harder time learning about small business owners.  I can't collect enough information.

The natural question here is why my response rate is so poor.

The answer lies somewhere in my initial email.  My first version of my initial email, which I send directly to business owners asking to meet them, is a lengthier email, maybe 300 words.  I make a strange ask in wanting to talk to them to learn about "painpoints" and "workflows."  I did a lot of rambling.  Quickly, I was seeing a horrible response rate with it.  Only one business replied to me to offer to speak with me.

Occasionally, I'd call a business to test my approach.  While on the phone, social contract discourages people to hang up mid-conversation, even if they're confused.  The phone gave me more colorful feedback.  I could literally hear the person on the other end being confused about why I was reaching out.

So, I changed my approach.

# My second approach is simpler, but still not good

In my second approach, I trimmed my message to the bare essentials.  Hello, I'm a first-time entrepreneur in New York who's trying to meet other business owners to learn how others do business.  Can I chat with you for 30 minutes?

For the second half of this week, I tried out my simpler approach.  However, my response rate is still poor.

# I need information

I need to inform my decisions with actual facts and data.  Unfortunately for me, I don't have much information at all.  If I want to find a product idea which people are happy to purchase, I need to get more information.

This week was a failure, but I still learned a lot, especially about how difficult it is to randomly talk to people hoping they'll share their problems with me.  I need to become more effective.
