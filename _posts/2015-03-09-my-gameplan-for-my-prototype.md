title: "My gameplan for March"
---

Earlier, I <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/month-4-february-2015-wrapup/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that I was trying to finish a prototype this month. I'd like to clarify my gameplan.

# Scheduling by budget, not time to complete

No, I will not finish my prototype by the end of March. I already know that it won't be done by then. I'm just allowing myself until the end of March to work on it.

Endless ink has been spilled on the difficulties of estimating the time to complete software and the costs of misestimating software tasks. I don't believe in estimating software. I believe in budgeting time for software.

You don't know how long it'll take to complete XYZ feature, but you know it's worth one month of development time for you. So work on it for one month. You'll naturally do the most important parts first, and you'll get the most important benefits while paying minimal costs.

I want to build as much of the important things as I can until the end of March. I won't be done, but any more time beyond March is not worth spent on the prototype.

# Putting it in front of customers

Come April, I want to start putting my prototype in front of customers.

The point of my prototype is to give myself <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/credibility-the-missing-lean-startup-tactic/" target="_blank">credibility</a>. My hope is that I'll have enough of a prototype to have credibility by April. At that time, I want to use my credibility and get as much market feedback as possible.

# It's okay to be embarrassed

Reid Hoffman said this famous startup <a href="http://startupquote.com/post/855482768" target="_blank">quote</a>:

> If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late

I hate shitty software. I'm expecting I'll still be embarrassed by my work at the end of March. Let's hope I can get a lot of work done and minimize that embarrassment.
