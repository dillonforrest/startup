title: Saving money on food
---

I have no paycheck.  Therefore, I need to minimize my spending.  No more new clothes.  No traveling.  No crazy parties.  I have to keep my personal expenses to the bare essentials: rent and food.

Rent is fixed.  It's the same amount every month.  My utilities might vary a little month to month, but not much.

Food is different.  In the year before taking the plunge and starting up, I cooked food myself maybe five times max.  I ate out the vast majority of the time.

I have huge potential to save money on food.  This means I can extend my runway and stay in the startup game longer.

## No more extra meat, no more guacamole

Eating out is expensive.  But I hated cooking.  So, to keep my stomach and spirits in good condition, I had no problem going to Chipotle regularly.  Actually, I loved it.  I love Chipotle.  It's quick, healthy, fresh, inexpensive, and delicious.  Why cook when I can go to Chipotle?

A chicken burrito bowl in a New York City Chipotle costs $9.00 right now.  Although that's more expensive than most areas of America, it's still cheaper than most other meals in New York.

But I'm a fatty.  I usually got either extra chicken or guacamole.  That'd be maybe an extra three bucks.

The first time I went to Chipotle after leaving my last job, I realized I had to abandon my typical burrito bowl order.

My typical order was rice and double meat. I always asked for no beans.  I preferred paying extra for double meat over getting beans for free.  And if I didn't get double meat, I'd get guacamole.  If I ever didn't order double meat or guac, it was because I wasn't very hungry.  But I'm a big boy.  I'm almost always hungry.  I almost always ordered double meat or guac.

The typical Chipotle burrito bowl meal: approximately $12.

My new order was very different.  Extra rice.  Extra beans, not no beans like before.  Yes to the meat, but only a single serving.  Extra vegetables and cheese.  But no guacamole.

The new Chipotle burrito bowl meal: $4.50, because getting extra everything except meat makes a $9 burrito bowl so large that it's two meals.

I didn't feel very classy asking for extra everything except for meat.  It made me sad actually.  I was a loyal Chipotle customer consistently ordering either double meat or guacamole for five years.  But I need a different lifestyle now.  New lifestyle means new habits.

Goodbye, extra meat.  Goodbye, guacamole.  I'll miss you.  But Chipotle, don't worry, I'll never be able to leave entirely, even if I'm trying to save money.

## Forcing myself to love cooking

Weird shit happened in my life in 2013 to make me detest cooking through 2014.  Cooking was something I once loved.  I wasn't the best cook, but I was pretty proud of my competency.  Even knowing that I once loved it and that I could in fact cook, my body had a visceral reaction against the notion of cooking.  The mess of grocery shopping, preparing the food, cleaning up, and washing dishes upset my stomach.

Now that I have no paycheck, I have a tangible financial incentive to reverse my hate for cooking.  Running out of money meant needing to find a normal job again.

At this point, my body's visceral reaction against a normal job far exceeded its reaction against cooking.  But I want cooking to become a long-term habit of mine.  It has to become something I enjoy.

Forcing myself to love cooking is probably not an effective tactic.  I'll have to genuinely enjoy it and make it a habit.

## An experiment to changing habits

My sister once told me that a habit can change if the reward for carrying out the habit changes.  To successfully turn cooking into a habit, I need to create a more immediate reward for cooking.

So, I'm trying an experiment.  The goal is to enjoy cooking and have it become a habit to save money and prevent myself from going out to eat regularly.  There's a lot to be gained if I can be successful, so it's worth thinking seriously about these experiments.

I'm testing a few hypotheses concurrently.  One, if my primary ingredients are foods that I love, I am more likely to enjoy cooking.  Two, if I buy cheap cooking tools which I think are cool, I'll enjoy the cooking process more.  Three, if I focus on perfecting a few dishes at a time, I'll steadily improve my cooking ability and expand my repertoire, and I'll enjoy cooking more in the long-run.

To test the first hypothesis, I'll stick with simple recipes that I'll enjoy.  This means not making my food too bland for the sake of health.  I should be happy adding extra butter and bacon into whatever I'm cooking if I'll enjoy it more.

To test the second, I bought a cast iron skillet.  The ridiculous weight of a cast iron skillet always seemed really bad-ass to me.  Things that seem bad-ass just make me happy.  It might sound silly, but I genuinely believe a cast iron skillet could be an important move because I think it's so outrageous for an amateur cook.

To test the third, I'm committing to a handful of dishes to master before moving on to other dishes.  If I'm unhappy with any of my dishes, I'll serve it to friends for feedback.

It's too early to say how this experiment will go.  But a successful experiment should extend my runway by making me happy with cooking and keeping me out of restaurants.

## Cheap eats

I'm not limiting myself strictly to home-cooked foods.  Since the primary goal is saving money, I permit myself to still eat out occasionally.  It's probably healthy to eat out at least a little bit.  Additionally, I'd expect to still be social over food.

New York is a city with millions of food options.  I've tried less than one percent of its offerings.  Now, I'll be going out of my way to look for the great cheap eats in the city.

Those single-dollar-sign restaurants on Yelp will soon be seeing me walk through their door.

## The downside of saving money on food

The downside is that I'll have to say no to a lot of social situations.  I can't drop serious cash on dinners or dates.  I can't go to Korean barbecue or nice sushi places.  Before, I'd attend meals with friends at more expensive restaurants without much hesitation.  It sucks that I have to say no now.

My effort to save money on food is definitely my first large sacrifice for starting a company.  Let's hope it pays off.
