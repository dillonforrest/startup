title: "It's my first launch, and I'm nervous"
---

Later today, I'll be launching my chatroom for entrepreneurs. The idea itself has already been done before many times, some with better success than others, but I'm trying to target an underserved segment.

I'm nervous. Very, very, very nervous. Why the fuck is the concept of my first launch unnerving me so much??

I had a dream last night in which I received a check for $8,000 (USD, for my non-American readers). Crazy dream, right? Dream Dillon receiving cash for nothing! Dream Dillon was so moved by suddenly receiving money that he started crying and melting to the floor. Dream Dillon was apparently very grateful for the money.

I woke up this morning shocked with my dream. I was embarrassed that money would move my dream self so much. I'm not even short on money, not yet at least.

Is this the pressure to make money that I impose on myself?

And that's not the only question on my mind. What if I launch, and my commitments to pay don't convert to actual payments? What if everybody is unhappy with my product offering and want their money back? What if I can't scale the product beyond the alpha?

As the day goes on, more questions pollute my mind. What if this is the only product offering for which I can receive any commitments to pay at all? Or worse, what if I fail altogether as an entrepreneur?

I think imposter syndrome is biting me in the ass right now. Fuck you, imposter syndrome.

Breathe in, breathe out. For the rest of today, I will focus on making the launch happen. I can't let my self-doubt get in my own way.

Dillon, it all comes down to perspective. No matter what happens today, tomorrow will always be a new day. The sun will rise again, and it will be another day to celebrate above the dirt. I'm an idiot for being so nervous about something petty like a launch. Right?
