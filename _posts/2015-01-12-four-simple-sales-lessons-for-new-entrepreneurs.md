title: "Four simple sales lessons for new entrepreneurs"
---

Early in my journey, I realized that <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/introversion-and-entrepreneurship-dont-mix/" target="_blank">introversion and entrepreneurship</a> don't mix. You need to be able to sell, no matter how much your inner introvert hates that idea.

Here are the first four major lessons that me and my introverted self learned about selling.

# The first ask should be easy to say yes to

I credit <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnBPetersen" target="_blank">John Petersen</a> with teaching me this. John's company is <a href="http://firehawkcreative.com/" target="_blank">Firehawk Creative</a>, and I first met John through his company site's open invitation to join him for <a href="http://firehawkcreative.com/blog/need-more-coffee-meetings" target="_blank">coffee</a>. He said that coffee is a small ask, so it's a natural first step which might elevate to a substantial business partnership.

Small asks are the key. A small ask should be something which is easy to say yes to.

I immediately applied the small ask concept to my user interview workflow. I realized that asking to <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/chat-is-the-best-way-to-interview-users/" target="_blank">chat via instant messaging</a> is a smaller ask than meeting up in person.

When you want somebody else's time, your very first ask should be something that's easy to say yes to. If not, it's easy for you to be ignored and forgotten. **After I implemented smaller asks, I've been able to conduct more user interviews at a much faster rate than before.**

# Understanding your user is your first goal, not selling to your user

This advice is perhaps more obvious, but it's so critical that it warrants repeating even to those who already know this.

The key to making a sale is listening more than speaking. Try to make a game for yourself to maximize the ratio of time spent listening over time spent talking.

I started benefiting immediately when I tried listening more. **Listening more than speaking gave me chances to learn more about the market and strenghen relationships even if you don't make a sale.**

# Offering help to solve problems is better than selling

If you understand your users' problems, you can help solve them. You don't need to make a sale. Pushing a sale sounds ineffective and unhelpful for your users. However, offering a real solution to their problems is helping your users. You make money by helping users, not by pushing sales on them.

Admittedly, when demand has been established, you might need to facilitate the sale to ensure the transaction happens. You might need to ping them and nudge them in the right direction when they drop the ball. This might be considered "pushing" a sale, yet this is a sale that both parties want. That's okay. Pushing a sale that only you want is not.

The ultimate benefit from choosing not to sell but to help solve problems is, ironically, that it's actually easier to try to sell this way. You feel less guilty and you're more confident. **Trying to solve problems rather than sell helps give me the confidence to put myself in front of other users and discuss my value proposition.**

# Know that not everybody will be an early adopter

I credit <a href="https://twitter.com/bosmeny" target="_blank">Tyler Bosmeny</a>'s section of this <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec19/" target="_blank">talk</a> of Sam Altman's startup class for teaching me this.

It can be hard to continually put yourself in front of others just to be rejected. However, you must remember that this is a numbers game. Perhaps only 2% of the market is willing to be an early adopter. 98% of the market won't be crazy enough to invest in a new product. **This made it easier for me to be rejected and prevent myself from getting discouraged.**

In running his company <a href="http://honeyandsoulpaleo.com/" target="_blank">Honey and Soul Paleo Goodies</a> with his wife, my friend William Lee commented that "everything boils down to a people-finding mission." Selling is a marathon. Don't quit early in the race just because a few people said no. They were part of the 98% not yet ready to take a bet on your new product.
