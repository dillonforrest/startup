title: "Holiday hiatus: It's time to regroup"
---

Starting today, my blog will be on hiatus until early January.  I'll be taking time off to be with my family.  The time off will be good for me to regroup and reconsider my approach.

So far, it's been 8 weeks of the most interesting time in my professional career so far.  I'm excited to see what comes in the next 8 weeks!

My blog will resume its normal publishing cadence on Wednesday, January 7, 2015.  If you'd like to be notified when I'm posting again, please join my mailing list!

Till then, thanks to all my readers for all the support.  You guys have meant more to me than you realize.  It's not easy being a first-time entrepreneur.  You guys lift me up and motivate me to keep going!

See you in the new year, my friends.
