# *Traction* directly influenced the way I prioritize my time

My biggest fears in becoming an entrepreneur were, and still are, marketing and sales.  I'm a developer.  Code shouldn't be a problem.  But I'm out of my comfort zone if I'm trying to sell and build a brand.

<a href="http://tractionbook.com/" target="_blank">*Traction*</a> is a new book which is perfect for people like myself.  It's written by <a href="https://twitter.com/yegg" target="_blank">Gabriel Weinberg and <a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares" target="_blank">Justin Mares</a>.  The aim of the book is to guide a startup on its pursuit for traction and growth.

My main takeaway is that a startup should never spend 100% of its time on product.  It should always prioritize traction, at every single step of both the product and company life cycle.

*Traction* argues that most companies fail because they can't gain traction.  This view is a twist on the traditional perspective that most companies fail because they don't offer a product that customers actually want.

My belief, as is the book authors', is that a constant effort to gain traction will help prevent building a product that customers don't actually want.  So, I spend at least 50% of my time attempting to gain traction.

# My favorite lessons

#### Never underestimate the challenge of gaining traction

When I was younger, I learned that a company can afford to mess up every single day as long as it was still selling.  I like the idea of affording to mess up.  So, when I switched to the founder side, I made revenue a top priority.

However, more popular metholologies like Lean Startup don't place much emphasis on traction.  Lean is a good framework for building a product that people will actually use, but it doesn't equip its followers with any ways to actually make sure people will discover and buy it.

*Traction* fills in the holes.  After reading it, you won't underestimate the traction problem.  You'll not only have a useful product, but also be able to win more business.

#### Slow and steady wins the race

Again, the recommendation in *Traction* is to never not work on gaining traction.  That means they recommend never spending all your time on product development.  The authors acknowledge that this means shipping product slower, but it argues that you'll ship more meaningful product in the long-run if you're constantly gaining market information and validation during your traction efforts.

I like a "slow and steady" approach.  It fits my style as a developer perfectly.  Hopefully it will define my style as an entrepreneur too.
