title: "Managing my time"
---

My favorite part of my full-time effort to start up is that I have 100% control over my schedule. Some of my other friends also attempting to start up right now agreed with me on one interesting point: it's difficult to correctly manage your time when you're trying to start a company.

# My time management misconceptions

Before taking the plunge, I thought that I'd have enough time to not just work on a product, but also work out a ton, cook a ton, write a ton, and sleep a ton. I was interested in reading more, but reading real books instead of just posts on twitter and hacker news. I also wanted to start taking chess more seriously. I wanted to take more photos and get better at photography.

I don't know why this wasn't obvious to me before, but my expectations were lofty and misinformed. If I didn't have time to do all those while employed, I definitely won't have time to do them while trying to start up.

# Working like hell

The first priority is to work like hell on starting up. My whole point right now is to get something off the ground. I can't not work on this with a 100% effort.

Before, when I was attempting to sell before writing a single line of code, my days were spent mostly trying to talk to people. Talking to people is extremely tiring. There's so much waiting for replies, waiting for appointments, just too much waiting. Frankly, not only did I suck at talking to people, but I also couldn't manage to do it for very much of my day. It was too exhausting.

My current plan is to build as little of an MVP to earn <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/preselling-to-enterprise-customers/" target="_blank">credibility</a>, just enough credibility to enable meaningful conversations with SMB customers. Building isn't a tiresome asynchronous process like talking to people. Building is fun. I'm more capable of working long and hard.

# Deciding on work priorities

Working hard doesn't mean working smart. Working hard doesn't mean I'll accomplish my goals. I still need to correctly prioritize my own work.

This is something I was looking forward to when I prepared to take the plunge. In my previous job, I hated having my work priorities sorted out by other people who were less qualified to choose my priorities than I was, but they had authority over me, so I had to listen to them anyway. I wanted to make these decisions for myself.

Turns out that when you're trying to do everything, rather than just programming, you have lots of difficult work priority decisions to make. Those are difficult decisions, and you have only your own time and money to lose by messing up. The decisions are still difficult for me today, maybe even more difficult than before.

# My other priorities

I decided to prioritize a few things outside of work which I really care about.

Sleep is the big one. I sleep most nights without an alarm. I'm not citing any sources here, but getting great sleep is more effective for your health and well-being than almost all legal drugs. I wanted to tap into that, so I make sleep a priority. I feel extremely guilty when I end up sleeping in too late, but it's definitely a luxury that I'd never envision while employed. Health-wise, I feel outstanding.

Working out is the next one. I don't work out nearly as much as I'd like to, but I try to hit the gym three or four times a week for less than 90 minutes each.

All of my other previous goals were basically abandoned. I put in zero time with chess or photography. I batch cook and basically cook the same food over and over again. I didn't read a single line in a book.

# My friends

I don't really see them as much anymore. It sucks. They tell me that all the time.

I try now to move my friendships to email and chat. It sounds robotic, probably because it is, but it's the easiest way for me to manage it. I still see friends occasionally, but definitely not nearly as often as before.

# During the workweek

I basically will work as much as I can, until I'm too tired. Sometimes that's until 6pm or 7pm, sometimes until midnight.

I won't start until a few hours after I've woken up. For some reason, I have a hard time focusing in my first hours of the day. I use this time to go to the gym and eat breakfast.

Sometimes I wake up and I'm ready to work immediately. Those are rare mornings. I don't squander them. I'll shovel down my breakfast and then get to work right away. If I was intending to work out that day, I'll just work out before dinner. Most of my friends at the gym work out around that time anyway.

During the workweek, my dishes usually go unwashed until I need a break. I'm trying to get in the habit of vacuuming during my breaktime as well.

# Resting and unwinding

I believe that the steady, consistent worker will outperform the sprinter. Rest is important.

I usually don't work on weekends. If I do, it's usually either fun stuff for me, probably relating to programming, or writing a blog post that I was supposed to write a day or two before.

I wrote a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/balancing-a-relationship-with-starting-up/" target="_blank">whole post</a> about balancing my relationship with starting up. The short story in this post's context is that I always feel happier when I'm with my girlfriend, and I think I'm mostly sane because of her.

# No feedback

I get no feedback on my time management decisions. I'm never certain if I'm prioritizing correctly. Ultimately, none of it matters if I can't start making money.

Maybe that's the only feedback that matters. Maybe no feedback is actually very strong feedback.

I'll find out soon enough.
