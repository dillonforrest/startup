This month was a lot of up and down. It's the largest emotional roller coaster for me so far.

# Done

#### A consumer idea

I spent two days taking a break from B2B and worked on a consumer idea. As I expected, it was super easy to validate the market for a consumer idea, as opposed to the much more difficult process of validating an enterprise idea. The idea broadly was to help renters in New York who had to mail a check to pay their rent every month, and make it so that you wouldn't have to remember to write and mail the check anymore. The idea was super niche, and surprisingly the market exists. There are even several competitors in this space alone already. However, there were lots of security concerns and not enough money to make those concerns worth addressing.

#### An information product

I spent a few more days validating the market for an information product idea. I was inspired by a <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first" target="_blank">post</a> by Amy Hoy encouraging beginner entrepreneurs start with a tiny product first, like an ebook, before offering more complex products, like software. I had an idea to do an industry white paper on hiring and retaining developers. Unfortunately, I just couldn't really get excited about providing an information product. I saw some demand for such a white paper, but I didn't see enough to feel compelled to pursue it further.

#### Met more experienced entrepreneurs

This was definitely the highlight of this month for me. I had the amazing fortune to meet a handful of more experienced entrepreneurs, all of whom gave me exceptional advice. The advice directly influenced my plan of action. I was struggling immensely at the beginning of last month, and these guys helped me find my sanity and a new game plan.

# Things I learned

#### Preselling to enterprise customers

This is my first major lesson from my discussions with more experienced entrepreneurs. I wrote about it at length <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/preselling-to-enterprise-customers/" target="_blank">here</a>. Because of it, I discarded my original goal to receive money before writing any code, and I started working on a prototype for a market that really excites me.

#### The cold email

This is my second major lesson from my chats with other entrepreneurs. I wrote about it <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-cold-email/" target="_blank">here</a>. 

#### This blog has been my only good decision so far

In my four months trying to start a company, my only decision proving to be good is this blog. This blog takes a decent amount of work. Lots of days I want to skip the post, but I kick myself and churn out the post anyway.

This blog is great for two reasons. The first is that it was the gateway for me to meet all the great entrepreneurs with whom I spoke last month. The second is that I've built a small audience which indirectly encourages me to persevere and keep working. Who knows, maybe this blog will turn out to be great for more reasons in the future.

# Things I did well

Me, things that I myself did well? Probably nothing.

This month started awfully. In retrospect, I think I was depressed. I had several reasons to be majorly bummed, and I was losing motivation. I was thinking about getting a job again and giving up on my startup journey.

There are two main reasons why I didn't end up quitting. One was that I changed my game plan. Spending time working on a prototype meant that I had something new to work on. It's a new hope for me to figure out how to solve real problems for real customers. The other reason is my girlfriend. Having a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/balancing-a-relationship-with-starting-up/" target="_blank">relationship</a> while starting up isn't easy, but I wouldn't be able to do it without my super smart girlfriend to help me.

If there's anything I did well this month, it was persevere through self-doubt.

# Doing

#### My prototype

For the first time, I'm investing serious cycles into developing an MVP. I spent about a week doing research to plan the architecture, and I've invested another week so far to build out the prototype. It's far from done, but I want to make sure my MVP remains minimal.

My current project aims to help web product owners understand how their users are using their applications. I'm not sure of any specifics yet until I can put my MVP in front of customers and get their feedback, but it's a complex technical problem which requires thought and innovation for which to deliver a solution.

# Goals for next month

#### Finish my prototype

I'm not building yet another CRUD app. I'm building software which I consider fairly complex. It's just as much a test of my own engineering ability as it is a test of the market.

Despite its complexities, the prototype can't take too much more time. Estimating time and costs to complete software is a sticky, uncomfortable, devisive conversation with plenty of ink spilled on its imprecisions, but I'll go ahead and say that I can only budget one more month to building this prototype. I need to work my ass off.

# Numbers

Revenue: $0.

I'm really panicking now. I've learned so much in the last four months, but I'm no closer to earning revenue than I was on Day 1.

I have a lot to learn and a lot of work to do.
