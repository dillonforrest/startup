title: "Sources of motivation"
---

My original goal was to just cover my living expenses. While I think that's a reasonable goal and a great milestone, I don't believe a goal like this is a source of strong motivation. It's good, and it should be a goal for every entrepreneur I believe, but it's not enough.

Starting up is really, really hard. You need to find the motivation to push through the resistence every single moment. That requires manic drive. I didn't have manic drive earlier, so I don't think I worked as hard as I should have.

Here's what I did to light a bigger fire under my ass.

# No safety nets

Since I have no debts or kids or any financial obligations beyond my own living expenses, I consider my startup venture is 100% risk-free. Nothing bad can happen. I can always just get a job again if either my runway expires or I want to give up.

Removing downside risk is good to take the plunge, but it's not good for being motivated. No downside risk means nothing to lose, and less hard work.

Now, I don't tell myself that nothing bad can happen, even if I intrinsically believe it. I removed my own safety net inside my brain.

# "Work like hell"

I got this phrase from a speech by Arnold Schwwarzenegger about his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyhOmBPtGNM" target="_blank">six rules for success</a>. "Work like hell" is rule #5.

I'm not sure what it is about this phrasing, but it really stuck with me. Said any other way, I don't think I would have really thought much of it. There's a certain aesthetic and a certain cadence to "work like hell" which actually makes me want to work like hell.

# Losing my girlfriend

I have a great relationship with my super supportive girlfriend. She's <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/balancing-a-relationship-with-starting-up/" target="_blank">helped</a> me immensely. I tell myself that she'll break up with me if I can't start making income.

She's stuck by my side this entire time so far, but that doesn't mean I can't brainwash myself into thinking she won't be around long if I can't get results. It definitely makes me work harder.

# Being a good son and brother

I don't want to reveal too much personal information on this particular topic, but I have important family reasons to earn income. The sooner I can earn income, the sooner I can be a better family member.

# No secret to success works unless you do

No hacks or tactics or tricks or cheat codes will bring you success without your own hard work first. Sure, hard work and <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/being-persistent-vs-being-annoying/" target="_blank">persistence</a> does not guarantee success, but inaction 100% guarantees failure.
