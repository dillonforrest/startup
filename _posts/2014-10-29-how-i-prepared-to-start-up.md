title: "How I prepared to start up"
---

The preparation to starting up is the only thing about entrepreneurship that I feel I can talk at length about, at least right now.  Every person is different, but here are the main ways that I prepared to take the plunge.

## I saved decent money

Originally, I was saving money for a down payment to buy a condo in New York.  I thought being a real estate owner would be cool.  I wanted to purchase real estate as quickly as possible.

I started saving the moment I left college.

As I got older, I began to believe that opting into unnecessary debt is a bad idea.  A mortgage is a massive and ultimately unnecessary debt.  Mortgage payments are preferable to rent payments only if you actually want to commit to your real estate long-term.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to make that deep of a commitment to real estate.

I know there are arguments about buying and leveraging with a mortgage having a higher ROI than renting, but that's not the type of ROI that I want to harness right now.  I prefer the flexibility that comes with renting.

My personal finance values changed.  Suddenly, I realized that I didn't want to buy real estate unless I could buy it in cash.

All that money that I was saving for my condo would now go into funding my startup.

## I grew to despise employment

Employment offered me lots of both good and bad times.  I bounced around between industries and company growth stages.  The eventual sum of all my employment experiences taught me something crucial about myself:  I simply didn't want to be employed.

There's an old saying that I read long ago:

> Why work for someone else from nine to five for a daily wage, when you can work twenty-four hours a day for yourself for free?

I feel silly for admitting that I didn't understand this saying at initial reading.  The math in the saying didn't add up to me.  But my perspective was all wrong.

Over the years, I felt my employed compensation was not worth the time that I was putting into my employed responsibilities.  I quite literally preferred no compensation and free use of my own time over giving up my best eight hours of each weekday for a daily wage.

Time is an unrenewable resource.  Money is a renewable resource.  This trade-off didn't make sense for me anymore.  Employment didn't make sense for me anymore.

This isn't to say that every job I've had was bad.  I've had good and bad jobs, good and bad bosses, and good and bad coworkers.  But in this stage of my life, I knew that employment was taking away my happiness.  Some day, I'll probably be excited about working for somebody else.  But not today.

I wanted to be happy.  I wanted to be unemployed.

## I was informed

I have two sources of recreational startup reading which delivered 90% of my pre-startup learning:

- <a href="http://swombat.com/founders_library" target="_blank">Daniel Tenner's curated articles</a>
- <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham's essays</a>

There's doubtlessly more great information out there.  These two are among the most popular, and they are my favorites.

After years of leisurely reading them, reading suddenly became less fun.  The articles started repeating themselves, and I wasn't learning as much anymore.  Obviously I still had a lot to learn.  Reading alone wouldn't make me an expert.  But having less fun from reading motivated me to get away from my reading and go out there and try implementing the readings' lessons for real.

I felt informed enough to try it out.

## I announced my plan to everybody

This is my favorite productivity trick.  I'm sure you've heard it before.  If you tell everybody your plan, you'll feel social pressure to follow through with your plan.  Your plan will get done.

I wanted to be sure that I'd quit my job and start a company.  So I told everybody.  And I did quit and start a company.

I think this trick works for everybody.  However, "I'm quitting to start a company" is not a particularly fun announcement due to the reactions.  The replies were often unhelpful, judgmental, or even unsupportive.  However, you take major life risks for yourself, not the haters.

The people who judge don't matter.  The people who matter don't judge.

## I saw the most upside potential with starting up

Lots of people have written about how startups are not the best way to get rich.  You're better off joining a soon-to-be-successful startup than starting your own if you want max money.

Money is just a type of upside.  My personal motivation is not maximizing money, but maximizing fun.  To me, employment just doesn't sound very fun right now.  Taking risks and learning to be an entrepreneur does.  It sounds immensely fun.

Starting up does not maximize my likely financial upside, but I'm certain that I'll have a lot of fun in the process.
