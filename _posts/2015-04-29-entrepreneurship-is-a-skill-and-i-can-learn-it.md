title: "Entrepeneurship is a skill, and I can learn it"
---

I approached my startup attempt primarily wanting to learn how to be a successful entrepeneur. My thesis was that entrepeneurship is a skill, and if I dedicate enough time and effort, I can learn how to do it.

My perspective on entrepreneurship as a skill is heavily inspired by my father's work. He's a mathematician who has been regularly publishing math books and papers since before I was born. I grew up watching him dedicate most of his hours in most of his days for most of his years just contemplating problems. Even in the shower, he'll be parsing logic to solve a proof. A mathematician can dedicate years or even their entire careers trying to solve one proof. I viewed entrepreneurship the same way. Entrepreneurship is a problem, and the least I can do is dedicate a few years to try to solve it.

The error in my original perspective is that entrepreneurship is less of a proof in a contained environment, like a game of chess. On a chess board, all pieces are visible for everybody to see. It's up to you to calculate advantages over your opponent while both of you share equal information on the board. I eventually learned that entrepeneurship is more like a game of incomplete information, like poker. You don't know everything that everybody else knows, and you need to gather more information. Gaining information advantages means gaining competitive advantages. This is where things like market research and customer development come into play.

But entrepreneurship is not just a game of poker. Entrepreneurship has a fucked up spin to it where you need to sell. You need to form relationships and trust with people. You need to convince people to give you their money. I have no appropriate board game or card game analogy for this. The infinite permutations and calculations, plus incomplete information, plus the necessity of sales is way harder than any math proof that I can envision.

And yet, I'm sure more people have figured out entrepreneurship than have figured out proofs.

I'm <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/im-quitting-my-full-time-startup-efforts/" target="_blank">quitting</a> my full-time startup attempt because, to phrase it with both chess and poker jargon, I have an unfavorable position and an information disadvantage. These are weaknesses that I have to address if I want to succeed in the future.
