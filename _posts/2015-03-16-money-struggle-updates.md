Previously, I shared some <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/struggling-founders-lifestyle/" target="_blank">moments</a> where my lack of disposable income created overwhelming anxiety. I'd like to share some more moments with you.

# Hot pot buyer's remorse

Some of me and my girlfriend's friends wanted to go to a restaurant which is famous for offering unlimited Korean barbeque and unlimited hot pot. At this restaurant, you choose whether you want the unlimited Korean barbeque ($30 USD), the unlimited hot pot ($30 USD), or both ($40 USD). Some of our friends were organizing it to be a big dinner with about ten people total.

I was super excited to go and eat unlimited Korean barbecue. Eating out is a rare luxury for me, so if I'm going to spend $30, I want to really enjoy it and get all the barbecue I want.

The tables at this restaurant have barbecue grills installed in the very middle, with hot pot boilers along the periphery. My girlfriend and I showed up to the dinner late. When we got there, the entire table was covered with hot pot food. All the hot pots were boiling. To my dismay, both barbecue grills were cold and unused, covered with hot pot food. There was going to be zero barbecue that day.

Our friends told us to sit and start eating hot pot. What the fuck, hot pot? I can't order my barbecue? I was stoked to eating barbecue all week, and now that I'm finally here, I can't eat it? I barely ever eat out, and when I finally do eat out and spend $30, I can't even order the food I want?

My friend saw I was unhappy that I had to go with hot pot, so he offered to clear away the table so that the servers could start up the barbecue grill. However, the table was small, and that meant clearing half the table. I was literally the only one who wanted barbecue that day. I didn't want to further cramp the table for everybody else, so I just went with the hot pot.

I was angry. Unfortunately, I spent the entire dinner upset and resentful that I couldn't eat the food I wanted. I would never spend $30 for hot pot. That's outrageous. I can get cheap good hot pot anywhere in New York. Korean barbecue, on the other hand, is always much more expensive. I would spend $30 for Korean barbecue without hesitation.

This dinner happened weeks ago now. To this day, I still resent having to spend half a week's worth of groceries on a single meal which I didn't want.

# Saying no to my girlfriend

More recently, my girlfriend offered for me to join her parents for Korean barbecue. Still feeling the buyer's remorse from ordering hot pot weeks prior, I said no, it'd be too expensive for me to afford.

My girlfriend was crushed. She's a tough girl, totally not the type to give anybody puppy eyes, but when I said no, I saw her defeated puppy eyes for the first time. I didn't realize how badly she was looking forward to this dinner with me and her parents.

I was immediately overtaken by remorse. I felt horrible for making her feel defeated. But at the same time, I felt guilty spending money on Korean barbecue so soon after the hot pot blunder. I also felt pressure to pay for not just us, but her parents too, because after all I'm dating their daughter.

I finally decided to go with them, and we had a great time. However, while I'm still without income, I'll limit the dinners I have with her parents at restaurants. I can't handle the social pressure to be the copiously providing boyfriend.

# Bragging about spending money

Some of my girlfriend's friends love to brag about how much money their boyfriends spend on them. They meet up with my girlfriend and gush about expensive dinners, expensive trips, bottles of wine, a ton of stuff that I'd love to provide for my girlfriend but just can't right now.

I can't sugarcoat how I feel about girls bragging to my girlfriend about their boyfriends spending a shit ton of money on them. I hate it. I despise it.

I despise that my girlfriend has to just endure it silently. I despise that her friends remind her that I'm unlike their boyfriends because I have no disposable. I despite that some of these girls are improper and inappropriate enough to literally say "Dillon is poor" to explain to my girlfriend why she doesn't get the same treatment. I despise that I always feel inadequate as her partner.

Starting up is a tough journey for the aspiring entrepreneur, but it's also tough for the significant other. My girlfriend is my biggest supporter. I don't want her to feel she made the wrong choice with me.

# Don't let these people affect you

I was complaining about her friends making me feel inadequate as her boyfriend. She said firmly, "Don't let these people affect you."

Okay. I'll try my best.
