title: "Month 0: October 2014 wrapup"
---

Although I've only been working full-time on my startup attempt for two weeks, the end of October marks the perfect time to begin my monthly wrapups!

# Completed

I did mostly product idea validation with potential customers.  In my first week, I invalidated my first idea.

# In progress

I'm still in the process of validating my second product idea.  Earlier today, my <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/" target="_blank">Hacker School</a> friend <a href="http://blog.danielna.com/" target="_blank">Dan Na</a> gave me some awesome information which might severely alter my product course.

# Goals for next month

If my current product idea receives enough validation, I'd like to have two paid alpha users.

If my current product idea is invalidated, I'd like to have validated a different product idea.

# Things I did well

### I resisted the urge to code before selling

This is not a segment about the "build it and they will come" myth.  It's about deciding what it means to be productive.

If you spend any meaningful time as an engineer, you couple the action of coding with the feeling of productivity.  Productivity is some function of the amount of coding you do.

However, as an entrepreneur, if there's no reason to code, then coding is unproductive.  Your developer reflexes might pressure you into coding, but coding in itself won't draw a salary at this point.

I just kept reminding myself, "sell before you build."

### I kept my spirits up

Wow, this entrepreneurship stuff is hard!!  The rollercoaster analogy is accurate.  A potential customer will give me enthusiastic feedback.  I'm on top of the world!  Another potential customer gives me critical information which shuts down my entire product idea.  I'm sulking at rock bottom.

Through the good and bad, I remembered to keep a level head.  Especially through the bad, I tried to remember that the world will keep spinning, the sun will rise again tomorrow, and it's another celebrated day above the dirt.

# Things I wish I did better

### Reaching out to people for product validation

Although this was my primary task at hand, the amount of work that it would take was completely unforeseen.  I knew that marketing would be tough.  But even just finding people for their honest opinions, not even their money or their business, was tough.

I was not very good at creating opportunities to talk to people for product validation.  Now that I know it's a weakness, I'll work to improve it.

# Things I learned

### You need a one-sentence summary

"Need" might be a strong word, but a one-sentence summary is so helpful that it's difficult to imagine any productivity without it.  I wrote about that at length <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-once-sentence-summary/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### People are good at knowing their own problems, but not possible solutions

An entrepreneur's job is to provide solutions, not the customers.  The customers can only give you hints and validation.  They can't answer the tough open-ended questions.

# Numbers

Revenue:  $0

I expected to make no money this month, but I hope this isn't a trend for much longer.
