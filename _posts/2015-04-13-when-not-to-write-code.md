title: "When not to write code"
---

Code is expensive to write and expensive to maintain. The only code guaranteed to be bug-free is code which isn't written. You want to write as little software as possible.

There are only two times which warrants writing software. One time is when there is no feasible way to deliver your product without software. Many startups can be bootstrapped with an excel spreadsheet and hustle before applying code to automate the solution. If your startup can't be bootstrapped in the same way, then write software. Sometimes you can't get around using APIs to address a market pain. The other time which warrants writing software is when your business requirements are defined, detailed, and unlikely to change. Software built in changing or uncertain business requirements is guaranteed to not work but still be expensive.

When should you not write code? When you can still solve the same problems manually and you're still figuring out your business constraints.

Right now, I'm trying to find alpha users to help develop my MVP. Some of them asked me, "How exactly are you going to deliver on these solutions? It sounds like a lot of code!" I tell them, "I'm just going to do it by hand. I'll automate it with software later."

There's a prevalent belief that you need to write code immediately. Right now, I still have no customers. My business requirements are in flux. It's a terrible idea to write code right now. I'll have to stick with spreadsheets for now, because my time is better spent updating cells manually rather than writing software to automate an undefined process.

As Bill Gates said:
