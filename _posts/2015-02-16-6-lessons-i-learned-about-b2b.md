title: "6 lessons I learned about B2B"
---

My struggle to have meaningful conversations with SMB and enterprise customers are <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/building-is-easy-selling-is-hard/" target="_blank">well-documented</a> in this blog. However, I did have enough conversations to still learn some interesting facts about the B2B customer.

# 1. B2B domains are ridden with technical jargon

Some of my conversations with B2B customers were difficult for me because of technical jargon. The problem is not just that I might not know the words, but also that different customers in the same space might use different words. Many fields do not have fixed terminology. Competitors in the same space often approach the same problem with different solutions, and these different solutions oftentimes lead to different jargon.

# 2. Your customer's customers are your customers too

I've read this elsewhere a long time ago, but it was still something I relearned recently. I noticed huge variances between the B2B customers who served consumers and the B2B customers who served other businesses.

Your customer's customers will lay down constraints for any solutions that you will offer to your customer. If your customer's customers use mobile more than web, than you might need a mobile-friendly solution. If your customer's customers are internationalized, then you might need an internationalized solution.

# 3. Market validation and product validation are long processes

It's currently trendy for startup people to post on Medium things like "How I went from idea to profitability in 10 days," but my guess is that they were all working on consumer ideas.

Validating either your B2B market or your B2B product takes time, a lot of it. Time means more rent and living expenses. I worked on one, maybe two consumer ideas, and their half-lives were ten or twenty times shorter than those of my B2B ideas.

# 4. Product ideas aren't easy

Lots of people intertwine the two separate concepts of market validation and product validation. I've validated plenty of markets with no product validation. Market validation definitely preceeds product validation, but not everybody realizes that they're not always done concurrently.

I invested my entire month of <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/month-3-january-2015-wrapup/" target="_blank">January</a> exploring the problem domain of web development agencies spending too much time scoping proposals. The market need was strong, but it was very difficult to come up with a good product for it. The market was validated, but the product was not.

For consumer domains, lots of times the solution is just simply saying "just create an app for it." B2B is not the same. The constraints are much higher.

# 5. You're fighting habit and inertia

B2B painpoints an be absurd sometimes. Fortune 500 companies waste billions of dollars every year just by being incompetent and settled in their ways. To close a B2B product, you need to combat their inertia. Sometimes this means the scary long enterprise sales cycle. Sometimes this means a value proposition that is beyond great, so much that it compels your customers to overcome their habits on your behalf.

# 6. The cold email is unavoidable

Yes, you need to <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-cold-email/" target="_blank">cold email</a>. Unless you're famous in your industry, your network will not be big enough.
