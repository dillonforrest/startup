Last Friday was my last day as an employed software developer.  I left my job to work full-time on my first startup attempt.

I have no product.

I have no specific business ideas.

I have no customers.

I have no sources of income.

I want to start a company, and I am starting from zero.

Every entrepreneur starts from zero.  Some turn out to be legendary.  Many remain floating in obscurity.  And lots more end up somewhere in between.

Despite the range of possible outcomes, everybody starts from the same point.  This is my own start.
