title: "My fight with discouragement"
---

Today marks the end of the toughest week for me so far. For various reasons known and unknown, I feel discouraged. It's pretty tough being honest about why I feel discouraged, but this blog is all about honesty. It's all about sharing the good and the bad. I hate sharing the bad, but that won't stop me.

# I dealt with haters

Haters are a complex concept, so much so that I have a post queued for next week dedicated to just haters.

When haters nag on you and you know they're wrong or you don't respect them, then shrugging them off is effortless.

It's a different story if a hater happens to be a friend whom you respect. It's even worse if this friend said infuriatingly inaccurate and misguided things while dismissing your blood-sweat-and-tears experiences entirely. I had moments this week were I was seethingly angry at this person. No joke, I would have beat his ass if we were in the same room. I was pissed off and probably not fun to be around.

But I breathed, remembered that he's still somebody whom I respect, and thankfully guided the conversation to a mutual understanding. Turns out that, despite his initial misguidings, he did have some interesting insight after all. A day or two later, I realized that my friend's initial dismissal of my experiences wasn't unreasonable.

Haters aren't haters because they intend to hurt you. They're haters because their actions, either with or without hurtful intentions, discourage you. Yes, I did sort things out eventually with this person. But the anger for having my experiences -- my blood, sweat, and tears experiences! -- so vehemently dismissed and the resulting discouragement were completely new experiences for me.

# I miss programming

One concept that I should have been aware of at the beginning of my journey was that you have to work so much on things you <a href="https://medium.com/@nicharry/startups-helping-entrepreneurs-do-the-things-they-hate-more-often-5e690fa5df1d" target="_blank"don't enjoy</a>.

Most of my blog has basically been a journal of my trial-and-error sales lessons. I haven't been able to start any programming yet. As a programmer, I'm anxious to start programming again, and I have the most fun while building software.

On Twitter, there was a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23reactjsconf&src=tyah" target="_blank">conference</a> for <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, a javascript library which I've been really excited about for over a year. Seeing all the awesome things going on with React made me miss programming more this week than usual.

I can always hack on my own side projects, and I always love reading about these things, but I started wondering if I should get a job to work on enterprise-grade projects with exciting tools. I just miss it, and it's been over a year since I worked on anything commercial that made me proud. Is it time for me to go back?

# My current focus might have reached a dead end

This month was dedicated to exploring the problem that web development agencies have with scoping proposals. I wasted a lot of time this month because I wasn't sufficiently <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/being-persistent-vs-being-annoying/" target="_blank">persistent</a>. However, despite validating a real problem, I'm not sure if I was able to devise a reasonable solution that others would pay for.

Turns out that if big problems exist for a long time, it's probably because they're difficult to solve.

I'm not certain yet if this is the end of the road for this problem for me, but I wouldn't be surprised if so. This is the most time I've ever invested in one particular problem, and realizing that things might be ending left me just plain disappointed.

# Don't give up

Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.

I told myself that I'd keep going as long as I'm still having fun.

Am I still having fun? Fuck yes I am.

What will I do if I see a hater? Flip him off and continue on my way, because fuck that guy.

What will I do when I miss programming again? I'll remember all the reasons why I wanted to go down this path in the first place.

What will I do if my current focus or my next focus comes to an end? Find the next project, of course.

# Thank you to my readers

Although this was my toughest week, I'm sure the future holds much worse for me. However, having this blog and my readers is one of the things which keeps me going.

For those of you who've accompanied me by reading my blog, thank you. Being a successful entrepreneur means knowing how to create value for other people. Sure, people say successful entrepreneurs should be able to make money, and blah blah blah, but the most value that I've created so far has definitely been for my readers.

I want to continue providing value and sharing my story as it unfolds, and I will continue pushing this journey farther.
