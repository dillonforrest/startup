title: "Can I not scratch my own itch?"
---

Conventional startup wisdom states that founders are more likely to build successful businesses if they scratch their own itch.  They should build businesses to solve their own problems.  I wrote a bit about scratching your own itch <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/im-changing-my-idea/" target="_blank">earlier</a>.

Currently, I'm still trying to validate product ideas.  It's week 4, and I'm still not sure how I'll make money.  I'm feeling a little more anxious than I was this time last week, but I'm not surprised either.  I'm glad I'm still mostly calm, but I still need to find meaningful product ideas.

To find meaningful market gaps, I try looking at the corners of my life which are the most painful, which need scratching most, which I can solve with software.  Alarmingly, I don't see much.  I don't sense any of my own problems that I can address.

Am I missing something?

## No low-hanging fruit

The first reason I struggle finding my own itches to scratch is because I feel like most of my painpoints are solved already.  Almost all of my problems have already solved with an existing solution.

I don't see any low-hanging fruit.  As a first-time entrepreneur, I shy away from the more difficult problems in the interest of maximizing my chances for success.  However, that's limiting my possibilities.

## Lack of access

My current general interest is entering a sleepy industry with antiquated, shitty technology and offering better software.  On the surface, this sounds like an amazing idea.  People are already spending a ton of money on software, but only some of it is modern.  Lots of incumbent technology is slow or frustrating to use.  There's a lot of room for improvement, and a lot of money on the line.

On the flipside, I realize now why few people have accessed these industries.  There's no easy access to them.  If there's no access, there's no distribution or expertise, and thus no sales or successful business.

This sounds like a great place for a non-technical cofounder to deal heavy damage.  If I were to partner with a non-technical cofounder, I would want him or her to have immense industry expertise and networks.

## Unfit to scratch every itch

Many of the problems in my personal life come down to things far removed from software.  They say that software is eating the world, but let's be real.  Software hasn't touched many, many parts of our world just yet.  Software has probably devoured a few corners of the world, but it only nibbled at the rest.  The best of software is yet to come.

There are tons of fascinating problems that I'd love to work on.  For instance, I'd love to have a ton of precooked, healthy, delicious food sitting in my fridge at all times.  But unfortunately, I know nothing about food preparation at scale.  I'm unfit and uninterested in scratching every itch that I have.

## My itches are common itches

A sobering revelation I had last week was that I'm not very atypical.  I'm a young male software developer in North America.  I am not an uncommon demographic.  Other entrepreneurial young male software developers in North America have already solved my problems.

I could choose to compete with them.  Maybe they aren't doing as good of a job as I could.  However, many of them are smarter and better than me, too.  Truth be told, when I think about competing with unseen faces of other young American developers, I get nervous.  At the moment, I'd rather not compete.

## Lack of imagination

My guess is that a serial entrepeneur might read this post and laugh at how much of a noob I'm being.  I'm sure there's a more imaginative perspective through which I can see more problems which I'm fit to solve.

I expect that this more imaginative perspective exists, that it's attainable with experience, and it's something most people can learn.  This will be a long-term goal for me.

# Can I not scratch my own itch?

My own itches aren't helping me find many product ideas right now.  Instead, can I scratch somebody else's itch and still build a successful business?  If my interest is injecting new software into technologically backward industries, how can I succeed if these problems are not my own?

When somebody gives you advice, you can usually find the underlying principle behind the advice.  When you understand the underlying principle, you'll know not just why to follow the advice, but when to follow or not follow it.

I believe the primary principle behind the advice to scratch your own itch comes down to knowledge.  You'll know your customers better if you yourself are a customer.

So, my hunch is that it's perfectly okay to scratch somebody else's itch if you can still understand the customers as well as you understand yourself.

# Let's try something new

Despite conventional wisdom encouraging solving your own problems, I'm now considering trying to solve other people's problems.  I might be decreasing my odds for each option, but I feel I'm increasing the number of options.

It's a good time to try something new.
