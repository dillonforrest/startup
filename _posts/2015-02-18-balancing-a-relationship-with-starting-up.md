title: "Balancing a relationship with starting up"
---

I don't talk about my girlfriend very much in my blog to respect her privacy, however I don't think I can overstate her role in my journey. I wouldn't have gone this far without her. This post shares our story as it pertains to me starting up.

# The beginning of our relationship

I was an adamant skeptic when it came to relationships. Generally I believed a relationship was a black hole to suck up your money, time, and energy while getting little to no love and support in return. My perspective was grim, but I considered it realistic.

Last summer, when I realized I wanted to start up, I was happily single. I thought that being single was a huge reason that the timing to start up was so great for me. I couldn't comprehend any successful venture while being in a relationship, so single is good, and single means it's a great time to do something risky for yourself.

Fast forward a few more months, to one week before I would finally leave my last job. One of my friends from school was hosting a Settlers of Catan board game night. I met a girl there who soon became my girlfriend.

Getting a girlfriend was unplanned and unintended. But I liked her a ton, and I immediately discarded my relationship cynicism. I wasn't single anymore, but I was still going to try to start up anyway.

# Similar to a cofounder

The best way I can describe my girlfriend's role in my journey is that it's like having lots of the benefits of a cofounder without some of the costs.

I wanted to be a solo founder because I just didn't yet want to work with anybody. I value my freedom and mobility to do whatever I want, whenever I want. I don't need a cofounder's buy-in to change ideas or approaches.

A cofounder's support is something that I didn't realize would be extremely important. When you're trying to start up, it feels like the whole world is spinning one direction, but you're trying to get it to spin the other way. The reality is that the world functions just fine without your business, so you need to put in a LOT of work to get your business to exist. That's a lot of inertia fighting against you.

Rather than having a cofounder, I have my girlfriend. Her support is not just something I'm unfamiliar with in the context of a relationship, but also critical to my daily morale. I might be mildly depressed if it weren't for her steady encouragement.

Another nice surprise is that I can bounce ideas with her. She currently works in finance and is interested in business and tech, and her input is always super helpful. She prevented me from doing several stupid things already. She'll probably prevent me from doing more stupid things in the future. I wonder how many stupid things I'd do without her.

My girlfriend is also primarily responsible for my perseverance up till now. I was so discouraged that I was close to quitting a few weeks ago. She kicked my ass back into shape and motivated me to remember my goals and keep going.

# Financing my end of the relationship

I joke that my girlfriend is my biggest investor, but thankfully that's just a joke.

My relationship caused me to reprioritize my spending. The original spending plan was to basically just cut down on all my frivolous spending and leave a little bit of budget left so I can hang out with friends. Then my girlfriend popped into my life. Now, I basically only spend money on living expenses and my girlfriend. When I hang out with friends, I either eat beforehand to avoid the dinner bill or ask to go to Chipotle. The way I spend money with my girlfriend is black-and-white different from the way I spend without her.

Even though frugality is a goal, I'm dissatisfied with my ability to take care of her right now. I just don't have the wallet to feel like a good boyfriend. We can't eat all the awesome food that we'd like, we can't travel, we can't go shopping together. My girlfriend has been awesome so far, but today's lifestyle isn't the future that I want with her.

It's just another reason for me to work my ass off and achieve profitability ASAP.

# Nothing bad can happen

A surprising side-effect from having my girlfriend is that she helps me remember that I have no downside risk. The worst that can happen is that I run out of money and need a job again. That's not a big deal.

Without her, I'd probably create a ton of undue extra pressure. I think it's good to have pressure to work hard, but the pressure shouldn't hurt your health. I let the pressure affect my sleep and my health a few times. Somehow, my relationship helps me keep the pressure in check. It helps me remember the big picture. Nothing bad can happen.

# I'm lucky

I'm lucky to have such a supportive girlfriend, and I try my best to treat her well, even within my current means.

I still believe that most relationships are detrimental to startup efforts. If you're fortunate enough to find somebody who will support you while doing this crazy startup shit, you better show your gratitude.
