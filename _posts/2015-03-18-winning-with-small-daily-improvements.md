title: "Winning with small daily improvements"
---

I didn't realize how much hard work was required to start a company. I haven't achieved any meaningful success yet in trying to start up, so I probably still don't realize how much hard work is required.

No matter how much I get done, I still feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work I still need to do. No amount of short-term productivity puts a dent in the long-term to-do list. This behemoth to-do list is my mortal enemy right now.

My bet is that I can win against my enemy if I accomplish something every single day. Mathematically, a daily 1% improvement compounded for 70 days will aggregate to a full 100% improvement.

There are two takeaways here. One is that steady input can eventually build up to a large output. No matter how discouraged I feel, I can't give up. I need to show up every single day and move the venture another step further. Work needs to become more than work. It needs to become a habit, or a lifestyle. It needs to be just a part of who I am to continue doing something every day into the unforeseeable future.

Another takeaway is that my efforts need to compound on themselves to make today's efforts more effective than yesterday's. I need to continue learning so that I spend less time floundering, more time executing. I need to continue refining my processes and my tooling to be increasingly efficient.

Build and sell, every day. Nothing else matters.
