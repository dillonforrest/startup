title: "Temptations to quit"
---

I'm only four weeks into my startup attempt, and I'm already tempted to quit.  Already!  It's crazy.

I've attempted to validate many product ideas, but none managed to secure any payments yet.  I'm considering money to be the only validation that matters to me right now.  If a customer doesn't pay, then the customer is telling me that it's not a problem worth my time solving.

# Starting a company is a lot harder than it looks

Overall, I'm happy with my decision to wait to be paid before coding.  What I did not foresee was the difficulty involved with finding problems which people are willing to pay to have solved.

Everybody says that starting a company is harder than it looks.  But even with countless warnings, I still am surprised by the difficulty.

Furthermore, I would expect this difficulty to continue for months.  I now realize how much time it'll take to understand a problem well enough to offer a solution worth customer money.

# Deflated ego

It was never a conscious thought in my mind, but I was expecting myself to do better than I'm currently doing.

A month or two ago, I would have expected that I'd be paid to build a product within my first four weeks.

Today is the end of my first four weeks.  I'm not anywhere close to that.

Was I being arrogant?  Naive?  Dumb?  Some or all of the above?

Either way, the last four weeks definitely deflated my ego a bit.

Truthfully, this adversity is unsurprising.  I always knew there was a chance that things might not go well.  But it's still a nice bite into reality.

# Free jobs

One thing I learned since trying to start a company:  it's easier to get a new job when you're trying to start a company than when you're actually looking for a job.

In the past, when full-time employment was my goal, I would actively seek out startups which might want to hire me.  Even as a developer in today's developer-friendly job market, you still have to go through all the interviews and code tests.  It's tedious and, oftentimes, really fucking annoying.  Finding a job was still a difficult process, even if the job market favors your skillset.

Now, full-time employment is the last resort.  I don't seek out a single company to work for them.  However, other startup founders actively reach out to me.  They give me the same talk every time about how, statistically, you're more likely to become rich by joining a performant startup than you are trying to start your own startup.  They try to convince me to quit my own startup attempt and join theirs.

I won't argue against statistics.  If I wanted to become rich, then they're right, I'd be better off joining a more promosing startup.  However, I'm not so sure that becoming rich is the primary goal.  It's not even one of my <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-criteria-for-success/" target="_blank">criteria for success</a>.

Despite my reservations and present lack of interest in employment, several people have tried selling me hard on quitting and joining them.  They're basically giving me job offers for free, no interview or code test needed.  The sooner I would start, the better for them.

I'm annoyed that it was easier to get a job now when I'm not looking for one, than earlier in my career when I was actively looking.  If or when I'm interested in working for others, I'll keep this in mind.

# Consulting part-time

One of the startups which tried to talk me into joining them seems pretty exciting.  The founding team's composition is ideal.  I met the CTO through a mutual friend.  Although he tried pitching me to join him full-time, I did end up agreeing to do part-time consulting for him, at least in the short-term.

While I'm still trying to learn about the market gaps which interest me, I definitely have enough mental bandwidth to do some freelance programming.  It's nice to be in a text editor again and building software.

# The path of least resistance and the path of least reward

The first money that I've received since leaving my job has come from part-time consulting.  I still have a ton of runway, but damn, it felt good getting paid.

I realize now that the path of least resistance is getting a job and trading off my time for money.  Building a business is definitely not a path of little resistance in any way.

My second realization is that it's also the path of least reward for me.  It feels good to be paid now, but is this how I want to pay my bills in the future?

The answer is no.

My fear is that the comfort of getting paid will move me from being a part-time consultant to a full-time employee.  Then I'll be back to where I started, and I'd have accomplished none of my goals.

# A one-third chance of quitting my entrepreneurship journey prematurely

My client is the CTO of the startup for whom I'm freelancing part-time.  His interest is to find somebody with a skillset similar to mine to work as a full-time developer, as employee #1.  He wants to know if I'd like to be that person.

I believe that this is actually a great opportunity in the objective sense.  Being employee #1 has great implications with influence, equity, and overall experiences to offer.  The CTO previously founded a YC-backed company, and this is his second startup.  He's clearly not the joker CTO that I'm used to seeing in tech.  He's the real deal.

We're giving both of us a few weeks to see whether or not there's a mutual fit.  I was clear that starting my own company is my top goal, but this is an opportunity which is too good to outright pass on.

I told this to the CTO, and now I'm announcing it publicly.  There is a one-third chance that, if the CTO still thinks there's a fit in a few weeks' time, that I will join him full-time and stop my startup attempt.  One-third means it likely won't happen, but you wouldn't bet too much money on it.

Entrepreneurship is hard, especially with these temptations to quit.
