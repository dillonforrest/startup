Last weekend, I had the great fortune to meet one of my readers, <a href="https://twitter.com/hrishio" target="_blank">Hrishi Mittal</a>. Hrishi runs a customer analytics company called <a href="http://gini.io/" target="_blank">Gini</a>, and he knows quite a few things more than I do about this whole startup thing. Hrishi helped me put together the last puzzle piece to understand why I struggled so much in the first three months of my journey.

# NASA confirms: you can't just talk to enterprise customers about their problems

Obviously, I was being facetious and NASA didn't confirm it, but Hrishi definitely did. I'm so pumped about having so much validation for this lesson that I can't help but wish NASA did confirm it.

You <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/validating-enterprise-business-ideas-the-wrong-way/" target="_blank">can't</a> just walk up to enterprise customers to talk to them about their problems. You just can't.

Hrishi agreed with Greg and Mike's lessons from my <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/preselling-to-enterprise-customers/" target="_blank">last post</a>. You're not worth an enterprise customer's time unless you can offer a specific solution right now. Trying to have a nebulous conversation about their problems following lean startup tactics is a waste of everybody's time. A specific solution is paramount.

# Don't talk to very small startups

Hrishi said that although he understands my desire to talk to very small startups due to the likelihood that they'll talk to me, the very small startup demographic is a bad idea. His logic was that these companies are so available to talk to me precisely because their work time is not valuable to them, not yet at least. That makes them less likely to spend money. They're just worse customers.

Ultimately, don't blindly conflate willingness to talk with willingness to spend. Duly noted. Thanks Hrishi!

# The cold email

Hrishi taught me some important tips on cold emailing, cold calling, and cold approaching target enterprise customers. I struggled with the cold approach for a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/convincing-business-owners-to-talk-to-me/" target="_blank">long time</a>.

Now, at this point, I know I've had some readers tell me in the past that cold emails and any outbound sales is just a waste of time. To that, I'll just wish you luck in your B2B startup journey without using outbound sales.

I now see the outbound sales process as a comprehensible system, not a black box. I think this is the first step to understanding outbound sales. Yes, it's a system that you can understand.

Hrishi shared with me some resources by <a href="http://www.quora.com/Im-a-developer-and-I-created-a-product-Its-time-to-sell-it-but-I-dont-have-any-sale-skills-How-can-I-convince-people-to-buy-my-product" target="_blank">Steli Efti</a>. I already bought Steli's startup sales guide. Although I haven't implemented any of it yet, I feel loads more confident with the outbound sales process.

# Giving up

I've been <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/temptations-to-quit/" target="_blank">tempted</a> to quit early in my journey. More recently, I fought off heavier bouts of <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-fight-with-discouragement/" target="_blank">discouragement</a>. I hated the idea of employment just 3 months ago, but suddenly employment was enticing again.

In speaking with Hrishi, I realized that my blog and my small readership is one of the main things that kept me going through the hard times up to now. I had internal dialogues demanding myself not let down my audience. Shit Dillon, you have readers. Don't disappoint them. Don't quit yet. Keep going! Smile and have fun!

Some aspiring entrepreneurs might purposely not want to blog about their efforts because, let's face it, the odds are against all of us. In the likely case where failure occurs, having no blog means that as few people as possible know about the failure, and life moves on.

Maybe I'm a weird motherfucker, but I wanted to live openly about it since the very beginning. I actually wanted any prospective failure to be as explosive and spectacular and photogenic as possible. But I didn't realize my blog's eventual role in fueling the fire to keep trudging along.

Sometimes I wonder if some haters check out my blog just to see how much I'm failing. Does my old boss check out my blog to make sure I'm not as good as I think I am? Do any exgirlfriends or any exboyfriends of my current girlfriend check out my blog to make sure I'm not succeeding? Do any people who just don't like me check my blog just to make sure I'm not reaping rewards that they don't want me to receive?

In my mind, each hater whom I envision visiting my blog turns into another drop of fuel into the fire.

# The new plan

As I said earlier, Hrishi's input on cold emails was the last puzzle piece that I needed to figure out what I was doing wrong. Now that I know, I can try again with a new approach.

My current plan is to revisit some previous ideas and build just enough of an MVP to create meaningful discussions with potential customers. Previously, I made it a goal to receive money, or at least commitments for payment, before writing any code. That goal is glorified by lean startup and such, and I think it's costly misdirection if you like enterprise problems.

We're all learning as we go.
