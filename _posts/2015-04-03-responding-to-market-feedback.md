title: "Responding to market feedback"
---

When you talk to the market, you'll get two different types of feedback: feedback you expect and feedback you don't expect. This might sound unremarkable and uninteresting, but please allow me to elaborate. My thesis is that you'll make or break your startup attempt by responding properly to the latter, feedback you don't expect.

Feedback you expect is good because you can either validate or reject a hypothesis. Testing your hypotheses is one of your main objectives when you talk to the market. My current approach is to attempt to test at least three different hypotheses with each conversation.

Feedback you don't expect is immensely more valuable than feedback you expect. This could include people not understanding your questions, not sharing the same terminology that you do, or just not replying to you at all.

When you receive feedback you don't expect, there are a few different explanations.

One explanation is that you're asking the wrong questions. You're testing inappropriate or unimportant hypotheses. This means your understanding of your domain is wrong.

A second explanation is that your product or your market is bad. Achieving product/market fit is a huge objective for every comopany, whether they actually call it "product/market fit" or not. Being unable to directly test your hypotheses could foreshadow bad product/market fit.

A third explanation is that your approach is ineffective. Maybe you suck at <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-cold-email/" target="_blank">cold emails</a> like I do.

Getting feedback that you expect means you can eliminate more known unknowns. Getting feedback that you don't expect means exposure to unknown unknowns. Your job as an entrepreneur is to manage both types of unknowns to your advantage.
