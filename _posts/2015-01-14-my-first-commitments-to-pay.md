title: "My first commitments to pay!"
---

Currently, I'm developing two separate product ideas. One is a tool for web development agencies to scope proposals faster, and one is a chatroom for likeminded entrepreneurs. The first idea is the larger idea with more earning potential, but so far I'm struggling to get meaningful information from the market. The second idea seems to have very little earning potential. I have a hard time taking it more seriously than a side project at the moment. However, for my chatroom, I'm receiving my first commitments to payment! People are willing to trade money for a benefit that I'm offering!

It's only the chatroom with only very little earning potential, but I'm still excited. I have yet to receive or even charge for the money yet, but it'll be the first time I receive money for offering a product rather than my own labor.

I'm trying to tell myself to stay calm and continue executing. There's no point in people paying me money if I can't create more value for them than they gave me. If I don't execute, I return back to the very beginning.

My new <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/chat-is-the-best-way-to-interview-users/" target="_blank">chat strategy</a> for user interviews is already helping me out. With each passing day, I'm more convinced that chat is the best medium of communication to learn more about your users.

Frankly, the proposal scoping tool seems not just more lucrative but also vastly more exciting than the chatroom. Although I'm happy with the chatroom's reception up to now, I want to refocus my efforts on proposal scoping after I launch the chatroom.

I'm shooting to launch by the end of the week. Finally, it's time to ship product.
