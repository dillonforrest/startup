title: "My launch plan"
---

One week has passed now in April. I spent half of it continuing to code my prototype and the other half talking to the market. I'm excited about the market feedback that I'm getting. I think I have a reasonable product to take to market, and I think I'm ready to ask people to be my alpha customers. However, I'm still not done building yet.

How do I launch and get customers for a product which isn't done?

# Rob Walling's Slow Launch

Last year at Microconf, Rob Walling <a href="https://vimeo.com/96267945" target="_blank">spoke</a> about his process to ship his new app, a process which he calls the "slow launch." You're supposed to execute the slow launch only after validating your market. After market validation, the slow launch proceeds as follows, in very abbreviated form:

1. Pick one customer to be your alpha customer
1. Do not charge your first customer
1. Work solely with this first customer as a high-touch consultant, building your product around your first customer's needs
1. When the customer is using your product and his getting value, start charging your customer
1. Repeat this process with the rest of your alpha users, onboarding them one by one
1. After you individually onboarded all your alpha users, start onboarding the rest of your waitlist in small batches

In its essense, the slow launch is a process to minimize risk and ensure you're building to satisfy real customer needs. I like this. I want to slow launch.

# What makes the slow launch work?

The slow launch is much more likely to work if you pick the correct first customer. It's more likely to fail if you pick wrong. Rob says your first customer needs to 1) be okay with you not building everything they want, 2) be patient with you being high-touch for a month at least, and 3) have needs similar to the rest of your target audience.

My longtime readers know that I'm interested in enterprise. However, I don't see any enterprise customers being either #1 or #2 for me. Enterprise customers want instant gratification. If I were to slow launch properly, I think I'd have to choose one- or two-person startups as my alpha customers. Rob's examples for alpha users were also very small startups.

If I want to eventually serve enterprise customers, I'll have to move upmarket after establishing some success with small startups.

# Finding the right alpha customers

So, perhaps my most urgent objective right now is to find people who want to be my alpha customer. This means I have to go back to my most feared part of business: talking to people.

Time to face my fears.
