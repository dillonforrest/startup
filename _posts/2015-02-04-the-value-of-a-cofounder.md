title: "The value of a cofounder"
---

I'm going through this journey alone. I don't have a cofounder. This was an intentional decision because I just wanted to work alone. Although I learned that <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/introversion-and-entrepreneurship-dont-mix/" target="_blank">introvertedness</a> isn't a healthy characteristic for talking to people about their problems, I was pretty confident that I would be okay otherwise.

I enjoy that I can make my own decisions on the fly. I don't need anybody else's approval. Teams are most mobile when the team size is one person. I can react to anything at an instant rather than waiting to get everybody onboard. I love that.

Unfortunately, not everything is awesome. The last week and a half have been the most difficult for me. Last week was full of <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-fight-with-discouragement/" target="_blank">discouragement</a>, and this week hasn't been much better. Although it's only been three months, I'm already starting to feel myself go crazy with self-doubt.

I think now more than ever is when a cofounder is valuable. When you're trying to start up, sometimes it feels like the world is against you. And if you have a cofounder, at least one person will be on your side.

If I find somebody who's passionate about a problem that I'm passionate about, and if our skillsets are compatible, then I'd be much more openminded to partnering right now. However, I'm still committed to giving the solo journey more of a shot. Cofounder or not, I can't give up.

How can a person traverse ten thousand miles? One step at a time.
