title: '"Are you scared?"'
---

Months before I took the plunge, I was sharing my plans to quit my job and start a company with one of my good friends from school.

Friend: "Wow, that's awesome!  Are you scared?"

Me:  "Yeah, I am!"

My reply was a reflex.  It left my mouth without any thought behind it.  After the discussion ended, I was bothered that I said yes, I was scared.  Fear was not the main emotion that I felt.  I just said "yes, I'm scared" because my reflexes told me I was supposed to say that.

# The largest emotion

Yes, of course there is fear.  Yes, I am indeed scared to a degree.  I have moments of self-doubt multiple times every single day.  But I don't feel scared because fear isn't the largest emotion that I feel.

The largest emotion that I felt was the frustration with being employed.  My frustration with having a boss and my burning hunger to go out on my own, together, both far outweighed my fear.

Additionally, I was excited to learn to be an entrepreneur and make my own mistakes.  Although excitement wasn't the largest emotion compared to frustration, excitement still outweighed fear.

# The driving emotion behind the plunge

One of my other friends heard me explain how my frustration overtook my fear for taking the plunge.

Friend:  "I'm not sure you're staring up for the right reasons."

Me:  "What do you mean?"

Friend:  "I think you're starting up more because your last job sucked, not because you actually want to start a company."

My friend had an interesting point.  I wasn't really sure how to respond at first.  After a while, I realized that he was correct, to a degree.  I do know that starting a company is my interest, but the events of my last job definitely influenced the timing.  If my last job didn't suck, I probably would've waited longer before starting up.

My frustration isn't the reason behind starting up, but it definitely accelerated my entrepreneurship plans.  The driving emotion behind my plunge is excitement about learning, having fun, and hopefully making some money.  However, my buddy made me learn that my largest emotion is actually my frustration.

# Be aware of your emotions, or else they'll control your actions

I have a lot to learn about emotional intelligence.  One of the first steps is simple awareness.

I am now aware that I have an emotional conflict.  I would classify my short-term emotion behind starting up to be my frustration.  I'd classify my long-term emotion to be excitement.  Excitement is a positive emotion, so that's the one that I'd like to drive my actions, both short-term and long-term.

I don't want my emotions to control me.  Awareness if my first step to being proactive and to be the one controlling my emotions.  My overall goal should be to be happier.  My frustration might mask my fear, but I can't allow it to overtake my happiness.

You can choose any star you want to be your guiding north star.  Choose wisely.
