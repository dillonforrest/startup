title: "The end of my startup journey"
---

It's been two and a half months since my last post! My time has been spent figuring out what I wanted to do, traveling, making plans, and executing on those plans. In that time, I did more interviews than I can count and moved from New York to San Francisco.

# This is my last post on this blog

Starting next Monday, I'll be working at <a href="https://nylas.com/" target="_blank">Nylas</a> to build the next-generation email platform.

I'm extremely excited about this opportunity for three reasons. First, the team and leadership. My top concern for my next job was maximizing the quality of the team. The Nylas team is sharp and fun, and I'm excited about its leadership. This is a team that I'm excited to join.

Second, the technology. Nylas is building an email platform. This isn't a cliche startup building yet another boring web app. This is one of the most complex applications I've ever seen. The typical web company's CRUD GUI is a vapid low-carb happy meal next to the Nylas GUI. Nylas has more data for a single user than most startups have in their entire database. Nylas is creating next-level technology.

Third, the business opportunity. This is a chance to change email. Email is something that we all use, but it hasn't changed much, and hardly any of us love our email experience. Nylas is an opportunity to create change which everybody can see. It's orders of magnitude more compelling to me than anything else I've worked on.

# What happened to being a growth engineer?

Previously, my goal was to become a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/integrating-back-into-the-workforce-after-a-failed-startup-attempt/" target="_blank">growth engineer</a> who wrote code to bolster marketing & sales rather than to ship more product. I pursued this plan from May to June 2015. This plan, to be frank, was dumb.

Many companies offered "growth engineer" openings. However, when I read the descriptions or went through the interviews, I learned that these growth engineers were no different from normal product engineers, except they built product for non-English-speaking users. I would call them "internationalization engineers" instead.

Only two companies offered a "growth engineer" role with a job description which sounded exciting to me. One was Buffer, with which I didn't get even a phone chat. The other was Intercom. I was excited about the role and progressed to the final on-site interview, but I didn't get the offer for some reason. I finally learned Ruby on Rails because of this interview, so overall the Intercom interview experience was positive.

In the end, only two job descriptions were suitable for me, and the rest were off-base. Long story short, I learned that being a growth engineer was a misinformed goal.

As I mentioned earlier, the first reason why I'm excited about Nylas was the team. Looking back at all my experiences at previous employers, I realized that the quality of the team is the most important input to be happy with my work. The moment I realized that being a growth engineer was a bad idea, I ditched the growth engineer plans and started focusing on finding a great team to join instead.

# How does a strong team signal itself?

The natural question here is, how does a strong team signal itself? How can you tell a strong team from an average team?

I don't have a complete correct answer, but my simple heuristic was to understand the culture. Companies which care more about writing detail-oriented software, making their employees feel happy, making diversity hires, and building their company for long-term success seemed to attract stronger talent, have more welcoming work cultures, and build stronger teams.

After finishing all my interviews, I felt Nylas was clearly the best option for me, with the most technical product, strongest team, best work culture, and most compelling leadership. I'm excited to start next Monday!

# Do employers like seeing a failed startup attempt on your resume?

Someone once told me that if you have no kids and debt, then a startup has no risk beyond forgoing your salary at a full-time job. He said you can always just get another job. However, some others might worry that employers don't want to hire failed entrepreneurs. Maybe just getting hired isn't so easy after a startup attempt.

After doing all my interviews, I feel that no single employer will see a failed startup as a negative on your resume. I never felt that my failed startup ever hurt me. I wouldn't allow the fear of being unemployable prevent you from taking the plunge and starting up.

Okay, so did my startup attempt help me get a job?

I would say that most companies didn't differentiate between my startup attempt and an ordinary job. They weren't very impressed by my startup journey. That was disappointing to me. However, I realized that these companies didn't have work cultures which valued the entrepreneurial spirit. Those were companies I didn't want to work for.

Fortunately, many employers found my startup attempt impressive and thought more highly of me because of it.

Overall, I would say that a startup attempt won't hurt your employability, but it probably won't help it much either.

# Building a business expertise

I previously wrote about wanting to become a growth engineer because I wanted to gain domain expertise in a business function. The domain that I chose was the technical aspects of marketing which required code.

I'm still very interested in this domain, but I'll look to side projects to grow my expertise. My main time and focus will go towards Nylas. Going forward, I will be aggressive about finding meaningful projects, both inside and outside of work, to address all aspects of self-improvement, not just building a business expertise.

# What's next?

What's next for me is just focusing on Nylas and my side experiments. I'm excited about these projects and want to work on them for a long time.

I'm not certain if I'll attempt another startup. The first one was a ton of work and sacrifice for very little gain. If I do start up again, I'll be much more risk averse than before.

Thank you to everybody who gave me advice and market information. Thank you to my family, friends, and girlfriend for the support. And of course, thank you to all my readers, whether I know you in person or not.

This is the end of my startup journey. It's time for the next step.
