title: "Feeling discouraged and bouncing back"
---

This week, I started feeling discouraged again. I wasn't alone. Some of my other friends working on their startup attempts felt the same. When this happens, we tend to wonder why we deal with the stress and the huge possibility of failure. We doubt ourselves and think about quitting. Our productivity tanks, and the startup attempts don't go forward.

A friend forwarded me an email from Victor Cheng of caseinterview.com. Victor wrote about overcoming failure:

I know my friends and I aren't the only ones going through crippling self-doubt. I'm encouraging all of you to keep going! You need to be <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/being-persistent-vs-being-annoying/" target="_blank">persistent</a>. I'm begging all of you and myself as well: don't give up.
