title: "What I learned about product/market fit"
---

In my startup journey, I learned a number of important lessons about product/market fit.

# The startup problem is actually two problems

The modern-day startup is two problems: finding product/market fit (PMF) and scaling.

The simplistic view is that finding PMF will preceed scaling. Finding PMF is the necessity to build a sustainable company of any size. Scaling is the luxury which you're afforded after you find PMF.

Startup advice proves that the startup problem is in fact these two problems by offering contradictory advice on various parts of building a company, and the prescribed advice usually depends on whether you're pre-PMF or post-PMF.

For instance, priority. Pre-PMF, your only objective is to esbalish PMF while burning as few resources as possible. Post-PMF, your objective is to scale effectively, and you'll suddenly invest heavily in growth areas for which you'd never consider in your pre-PMF days.

Or aversion. Pre-PMF, you should be cost-averse. Extend your runway as long as possible. Post-PMF, you should be risk-averse. You value predictable costs and returns over gambles. You become price insensitive.

Or venture funding. Pre-PMF, you're generally discouraged from raising capital. Post-PMF, you're generally encouraged to do so, and in fact it'll be much easier for you to raise capital if you can prove you established PMF.

Or people. Pre-PMF, you're generally discouraged from hiring many people, if any at all. Post-PMF, you're encouraged to ramp up your headcount rapidly.

There is contradicting advice because the advice is meant for two completely separate audiences. Different advice for different audiences with different problems, even though both audiences are working on startups. Startups are actually a PMF problem plus a scaling problem.

# How to search for PMF

I'm not sure what's the best way to search for PMF. I do know that it's generally not a good idea to quit your job and search for a market full-time the way I did. It's possible, but it's stacking the cards against yourself.

There's lots of advice floating around the internet on finding PMF. Some of it is good, and some of it is bad. Some of it is good only if applied to the correct context, or if some other unstated condition is met. You won't really know until you try.

# Finding PMF could take forever

The problem with my startup attempt was that my journey eventually reduced down to an indefinite search for PMF, while my runway continued to burn.

I believe is that market validation, which is the first half of the PMF problem, is mostly an asynchronous process. You can validate a market while working another day job. There's no benefit to having your entire schedule dedicated to validating a market. You'll spend too much time waiting to make it worth forgoing any salaries.

The search for PMF could take a while. You won't solve it simply by working on it harder. That's not how asynchronous problems work.

# A business's main objective is product/market fit

You can make a strong argument for the startup's only real objective to be finding PMF. Scaling is not an actual problem. It's a difficult task to accomplish, one that companies are willing to spend tons of money on to solve, but calling it an actual "problem" is a bit of a stretch of semantics.

A sustainable business must have PMF. A sustainable business can choose to attempt to scale, or it can choose not to scale. Scaling itself is not usually a life-threatening problem. However, every single sustainable business, including the ones which aren't capable of scaling or choose not to scale, has PMF. This includes MSG-loaded Chinese takeout restaurants, fitness gyms with rusty equipment and antiquated software, and ice cream trucks.
