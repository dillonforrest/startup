title: "I can't make money from local small businesses"
---

In November, I <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-criteria-for-success/" target="_blank">committed</a> a week or two to learning more about local small businesses.

For clarity, I define a local small business as a company which doesn't exist beyond just one town.  You can count the staff with your fingers.  They have a brick and mortar store, with a crappy or nonexistent online store option.  They probably don't sell software, probably real physical goods and services instead.

This is my longest post so far, but I encourage you stick with it until the end.  I have lots of interesting info to share!

# My local small business experiment

My hypothesis at the time was that I'd be able to find local small businesses to serve.  If I spoke with enough of them about their problems, I'd find a way to help out and build a business.

I purposely picked out local small businesses that had at least three stars on yelp, with customers who pay at least $200/month, with a shitty website.

Three stars on yelp signalled to me that they were doing pretty well as a company, knew their domain, and would expect to stay in business for much longer.

I wanted businesses whose customers paid over $200/month because I figured they would be the easiest to sell to.  If each customer earns that much revenue, then I figured the businesses had comparatively more to gain with process and software improvements, and comparatively more to lose with each unhappy customer.

The shitty website was the criterion that I cared about most.  To me, a company with a shitty website meant that they probably had shitty software and shitty, expensive processes.  A shitty website gave me confidence that I could help that business make more money while making money myself.

My expectation was for local small businesses to be ecstatic that a developer wanted to make tools for them.

# The experiment results were terrible

I was wrong.  Local small businesses weren't excited to talk to me.

This comes in sharp constrast to my experience in tech.  In my several years in the New York tech scene, I learned that startups have a very strong pay-it-forward culture.  It's not hard to form genuine and meaningful relationships with startup founders.  People are happy to offer advice and perspective.

Local small business owners are not like modern startup founders.  They will NOT take up your offer for coffee.  They will ignore the shit out of you.  An exceptional few will make an exception, but I emphasize that these owners are exceptional, far from the norm.

I had such a hard time talking to local small business owners that I gave up.  The experiment results were disappointing, but thankfully costed only a week or two.  Not many owners spoke with me, so I didn't learn much about their problems.  I am convinced that not pursuing local small businesses was the correct move.

However, I still learned a ton.

# Surprising lessons about local small businesses

These lessons won't be a surprise for everybody, but they will if you are a 20-something who grew up with internet.

#### Local small business owners don't care

I was betting that a company's shitty website signalled that the company was very offline, enough so that I could easily provide better technology for them.  I was right.

I thought that meant an easy business opportunity.  I was wrong.

A shitty website signals more than just shitty technology.  It signals a general apathy to many modern and popular business and tech principles.

A modern startup cares about branding, customer acquisition costs vs customer lifetime value, distribution, competition, etc.  A typical local small business owner cares much less, or not at all, about all of those things.  The typical owner doesn't think about latency or responsiveness.  The typical owner doesn't try very hard to create a reputation for having good customer service.  The typical owner has a very visible apathy towards these concerns.  In fact, the typical owner with meaningful success probably garnered four stars on yelp by accident.

I would bet the owner would never get five stars.  The businesses with five stars care too much about customer service to be the typical cool-headed owner.  If you see a small business on help with five stars, I'd expect it's also using modern technology and has a nicer website.

#### Local small business owners accept lots of inefficiency

Just as humans are creatures of habit, so too are small businesses.  A bad process, like a bad habit, will possibly never be reversed.

The typical owner of a local small business is very accepting of inefficiency in large doses.  They will not remove an inefficiency just for the prospect of improvement.  They will only remove inefficiencies if there is pain.  If there is a painless inefficiency, the owner will not address it.

This could be due to lack of time to address nonurgent inefficiencies or, like stated above, apathy.  I'm not sure.

#### Local small business owners have less demands

A modern startup with hypergrowth aspirations will have many more demands than the typical local small business.

The small business won't care about scaling itself as an organization.  It won't try to create amazing customer service experiences.  It won't try keeping up with technology.  It won't care about its data or any business intelligence.

Many small businesses are in maintenance mode.  The owners aren't trying to grow.  They are just living and working.

# Business lessons from local small businesses

#### Not every business owner wants to make the most money

I now see two types of business owners based on this <a href="http://qr.ae/lj6FT" target="_blank">short story</a>:

> A businessman took a short vacation to a small Greek coastal village. Unable to sleep he walked the pier.  A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna. 
>
> “How long did it take you to catch them?” he asked. 
>
> “Only a little while” the Greek fisherman replied. 
>
> “Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?" he asked. 
>
> “I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Greek fisherman said as he unloaded them into a basket.
>
> “But …. What do you do with the rest of your time?” 
>
> The fisherman looked up and smiled” I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a nap with my wife and stroll into the village, where I sip wine and play guitar with my friends”.
> 
> The businessman laughed “Sir I am an MBA and can help you. You should fish more, and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat. In no time you could have several boats with the increase haul. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Then instead of selling your catch to the middleman, you could sell directly to the consumers. You could control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal village and move to the city to run your expanding empire." 
>
> The fisherman asked “But, sir, how long will all this take?”
>
> “15- 20 years, 25 tops” said the businessman. 
>
> “But what then?” asked the fisherman.
> 
> The businessman laughed and said “That’s the best part, when the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions”.
>
> “Millions? Then what?” asked the fisherman.
>
> The businessman replied, “Then you could retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you could sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a nap with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play guitar with your friends."
 
The typical owner of a local small business is like the fisherman.  The small business owners are "fishermany."  The more modern tech startup founder is more like the businessman.  They're "businessmany."  I'd bucket Fortune 500 and finance into the businessmany category alongside tech.

The fishermany owner is, no offense, not as great at business.  There are too many opportunities for increased profits not taken to be considered otherwise.  It's common for a modern tech startup to offer extreme empathy for a customer complaint.  It's not surprising if a local small business doesn't react too warmly to a similar complaint.  The fishermany owner doesn't mind if you leave a one-star yelp review or send an angry tweet.

Fishermany owners don't try very hard to make the most money.  Only businessmany people do.

#### The importance of good business fundamentals

Despite many of them not showing good business sense, many fishermany owners run more successful companies than businessmany owners.

Fishermany owners succeed on good business fundamentals.  They provide something that people pay for.  They spend less than they make.  They don't need any modern business practices as long as they have their fundamentals down.

#### Market sustenance is as valid of a goal as market dominance

Businessmany founders want to become the market leaders in their industries.  Businessmany people are always blogging and tweeting about growth, strategy, scaling.  When it's all said and done, only a few companies will remain in the industry with any reasonable market share.

Fishermany owners strive for market sustenance, not market dominance.  They are happy just moving along with their lives.  They don't hatch schemes to steal away their competitors' customers.  They're happy with their own fraction of the market.

If fishermany owners were dissatisfied and wanted more business, they'd change their ways.  Their sedentary nature signals to me that they are content.

# Old school vs new school

I was a young developer hoping to make software for traditional brick-and-mortar mom-and-pop stores.  That is a clash of generations.  Business is inherently social.  If there is a clash, it's harder for meaningful business to occur.

I predict that the businessmany way of business will eventually overtake the fishermany way.  Businessmany is all that exists in all online business publishing.  Fishermany businesses are all offline in a decreasingly offline world.  In ten or twenty years, fishermany businesses might be extinct, save for a few bubbles of happily coexisting fishermany businesses.

Learning about fishermany business made me reconsider my own motives for starting up.  My <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-criteria-for-success/" target="_blank">criteria for success</a> seem more compatible with fishermany business than startupy business.  Businessmany business is surely today's mainstream, while fishermany business in comparison is more zen, Fight Club-esque, even hipster.  I think there's a lot more to be learned from the fishermany way.

The final takeaway from my local small business experiment was that I should focus my efforts more on businessmany people.  Although I have fishermany criteria for success, my skillsets, interests, and experiences are all very businessmany.  I am less afraid to sell to businessmany customers than fishermany customers.  This is one comfort zone I won't try to leave soon.
