title: "Most days are bad days"
---

I have a few friends currently trying to start up like I am. Most of us keep track of our daily mood in some way. I personally use <a href="https://idonethis.com/home/" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a>. Every day, at the end of my day, I write a sentence to elaborate on my mood and then write down my day's accomplishments. The next day, iDoneThis emails me the previous day's accomplishments as well as my mood. I can log into iDoneThis and see my mood across an entire calendar.

One of my friends -- let's call him "Dave" -- uses a white board calendar. At the end of the day, he draws either a smiley face or a frowny face depending on how he feels his day went. A smiley face means he's happy with his productivity for the day.

It's great to track your progress, but it can be depressing to see how many bad days you've had.

# One good day per week

In the last few weeks since starting my <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-gameplan-for-my-prototype/" target="_blank">prototype</a>, I estimate that I have one day every week which I'm pretty happy about. If I get two or even three good days, then the week is counted as an extraordinary week.

Dave is the same. With his emoticon white board, if he gets a week with three smiley faces, it's a great week for him.

Personally, I find it hard to be happy with my progress. I'm only happy if that day I made a huge breakthrough or was randomly super productive. Even when that happens, the happiness is transient. By the next day, I'll be back to my Dillon Downer self.

# Zero good days

In the beginning, when I was going about market validation the <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/validating-enterprise-business-ideas-the-wrong-way/" target="_blank">wrong way</a>, I had almost no good days. That was three solid months of not having a single good day. Every single day sucked.

If you're having zero good days every single week, then I have two interpretations.

The first interpretation is market or product invalidation. If things suck, then they're just not meant to be. It's a bad market, so stop and find a new market. Or, it's a bad product, so stop and figure out something better.

The second interpretation is ineffectiveness. You're working hard, but not working smart. My most relevant personal examples are when I finally learned how to <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-cold-email/" target="_blank">cold email</a> and to not be afraid of being <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/being-persistent-vs-being-annoying/" target="_blank">annoying</a>. You might need to change your approach.

# The solo founder

Dave pointed out that having so few good days might be part of the solo founder's journey. He points out:

> With two founders, each with 50% chance of not being on their A game, 75% of the time at least one of the founders is on their A game and can give the other guy the boost he needs

# Weirdly optimistic

The string of bad days is yet another reason why I believe entrepreneurship requires being <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/entrepreneurship-requires-being-weirdly-optimistic/" target="_blank">weirdly optimistic</a>. So much goes wrong, and so little goes right. As far as I can tell, as long as you're having good days at all, you're probably doing something right. Keep persevering.
