title: "Month 6: April 2015 wrapup"
---

Since I decided this month to <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/im-quitting-my-full-time-startup-efforts/" target="_blank">quit</a> my startup attempt, this will be my last monthly wrapup, at least until I try to pursue a startup attempt full-time again.

# Done

#### Customer development

March was all about building. April was all about putting what I built in front of people. I had more really meaningful conversations with the market last month than the previous five months combined.

#### Improvements on my prototype

Customer development is mostly asynchronous, so I still dedicated a good amount of time hacking on my prototype.

#### Hit blog posts

I wrote a few posts which became pretty popular last month. My <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/why-im-using-clojure-to-start-up/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/the-benefits-of-clojure-for-starting-up/" target="_blank">posts</a> about using clojure on my startup attempt were the most popular posts I've ever had. I also posted a comprehensive look at my <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/my-9-biggest-mistakes-thus-far/" target="_blank">worst mistakes</a>.

#### Got 3 alpha users

I had 3 startups agree to be alpha users before I pulled the plug. I'm very proud that I at least had verbal commitments to alpha users on my MVP iteration. I would publicly call my startup attempt a failure, but it's a failure that I readily accept because I at least had alpha users.

# Things I learned

#### How to do customer development

Customer development was extremely difficult for me to learn the hard way. However, this time around, with both a prototype and more experience, it was much easier. If I had to do this again, I'm 100% confident I can quickly figure out the most effective way to talk to the market.

#### Underserved market segments are difficult to find

I thought this would be easier to do. It's not easy. There are plenty of reasons that people will be less than 100% happy. However, not all of these reasons will be the same. When a large number of reasons converge, then you have an underserved market segment. If it requires immense due diligence to find an underserved market segment, my prediction is that it doesn't actually exist.

# Doing

#### Figuring out what to do next

I'm not sure what I'll do next. I have a lot to think about. I have many ideas though. My posts in the next month will be about how I plan to prepare for my next startup attempt.

# Numbers

Revenue: $0

I made precisely zero money in my startup attempt. I'll reiterate this in case it was unclear: this startup attempt was a failure. I won't call it a moral victory just because I learned a ton. Learning was one of my biggest goals, but learning in itself is not how we keep score. I demand more than that out of myself.
