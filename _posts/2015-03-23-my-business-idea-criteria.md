title: "My business idea criteria"
---

I frequently discuss business ideas with one of my friends who's also trying to start up. I think it's important not to be a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/all-about-haters/" target="_blank">hater</a>. I'd rather be the <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/all-about-haters/" target="_blank">optimist</a>. However, it's important to still balance optimism with practicality. I do that by minding these business idea criteria:

- The market already has competitors who make money
- The market is growing
- Your own skillset is appropriate to service this market
- You are interested in this market

Why are existing profitable competitors important? You want somebody else to do the work to validate the market. If somebody else is already making money, you probably can find a way to make money there too.

Why is market growth important? Growth means the market is dynamic enough to permit new entrants, such as yourself. Growth means more and more money will flow into that market. You won't be fighting for a larger slice of the pie with your competitors. You'll be able to coexist with your own growing slices of pie.

The other two criteria are more obvious. You can't enter a market in which you can't execute. You can't succeed if you're not excited and interested in the problem and the solution.

At that point, it's all about finding an underserved segment in the market, building <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/credibility-the-missing-lean-startup-tactic/" target="_blank">credibility</a>, and working your ass off.
