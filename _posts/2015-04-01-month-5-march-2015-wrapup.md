title: "Month 5: March 2015 wrapup"
---

<a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/month-4-february-2015-wrapup/" target="_blank">February</a> was by far my most educational month. March was the month for me to capitalize on my new knowledge.

# Done

I did precisely one month's worth of building my prototype. I discarded traditional startup wisdom's "sell before you build" advice because I didn't have enough <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/credibility-the-missing-lean-startup-tactic/" target="_blank">credibility</a> to presell to <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/preselling-to-enterprise-customers/" target="_blank">enterprise customers</a>.

I could definitely use more time to build even more. More building would mean I'd feel prouder of my work before showing it to potential customers. Unfortunately I don't have the luxury of more time. I budgeted one month, so one month is exactly how much I spent.

# Things I learned

I bet on <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/why-im-using-clojure-to-start-up/" target="_blank">bleeding edge</a> technology to build my own software. More specifically, I'm using clojure, clojurescript, and datomic rather than a more traditional stack like ruby, javascript, and mysql. Learning clojure and clojurescript have been mostly painless and mostly awesome. The learning curve for both tools is very soft. Datomic, on the other hand, was a bit tougher. I never had show-stopping moments with datomic. Although I had a hard time googling my answers, I always eventually found my answers from either the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> zulip chat room or the #datomic IRC room. I'll be writing more posts in the future about how my bet on bleeding edge will or won't pay off.

# Things I did well

I still talked to the market while mostly coding. I didn't want to be in a complete vacuum. I spent maybe 2% of my time talking to the market. My feedback was overall encouraging. Of course, it was only 2% of my time for a month, so the odds of a false positive are substantial.

# Doing

Still more work on the prototype. Although I'm ready to show it to people, I'm not ready to charge money for it. Even I wouldn't pay money for my own product right now. It needs more work to derive value for any customers.

However, from this point on, I'll be spending only 50% of my cycles on product. The other 50% will be dedicated towards talking to the market to influence the direction of my code. I'll be reviewing my copy of <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/book-review-traction/">"Traction"</a>.

# Numbers

Revenue: $0

Last month was the first month I knew for a fact that I wasn't going to make any money. But shit, it's been five months with still no revenue. Although I worked hard last month, the real work has yet to begin.
