title: "Founders disagree on how to build startups"
---

Since taking the leap, I spoke with many startup founders.  Some of them I met for advice on starting a company.  Some I met to learn more about problems which I might be able to solve with my own products.

The conversations were different, but I caught a recurring theme between each conversation.  Everybody had a different vision on the proper way to build a company.

# Fundraising

The main point of contention was easily the role of fundraising for a startup.

Most founders consider fundraising a critical aspect to starting a company.  <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/how-to-fund-your-startup/" target="_blank">Bootstrapping</a> was a lesser path.  These founders wouldn't ask me "do you want to raise funding," but rather, "when will you raise funding?"  One founder went as far as to say that the typical bootstrapped company will never become anything substantial.

A minority of founders were fans of bootstrapping.  They preferred retaining control over their company and growing organically.

Many founders acknowledge that today is a great time to fundraise if you want to.  Capital is cheap, and everybody is trying to invest.  Companies like Snapchat, which raise capital on a valuation on the order of billions but without a revenue model, reduce the public perception of VCs, and these founders love taking jabs at them.

One proudly bootstrapping founder dropped an interesting nugget for me.  He said that although he's bootstrapping, he always keeps the door open to investors and continues conversations with them.

Bootstrapping founder:  "You never know when a competitor enters the market, doing the exact same thing as me, and raises capital.  Then I'll have to raise capital too to compete!  Otherwise their resources might run me out of business!"

# Objectives

Related to the disagreements on fundraising are the disagreements on the objective for a startup.

The founders who chose to bootstrap aspire for natural growth.  They want to grow out of good business fundamentals:  providing value and being paid for it.

The founders who chose to raise money fall under two categories.

The first is the industry domination category.  They want to expand in their niche until they own it, and then expand in the industry until they dominate it.  Hypergrowth and massive scalability is the dream for them.

The second is the how-the-fuck-will-we-make-money category.  They raised money off of an interesting idea.  However, they're the ones with no revenue model.  These founders seem less driven by making money and more driven by social change.  Their investors still hope for them to eventually make a return on their investment.

In my view, neither category of fundraising founders is better than the other.  The fundraising founders can't really choose the objective of their startups anyway.  As soon as you raise capital, you have investors to report to.  An attempt at hypergrowth is mandatory.

The bootstrapping founders were more empowered to choose their adventure.  One of them pointed out that 99% of companies in the US are just a simple restaurant or dry cleaner.  Not every company needs to take over the world.  Not every founder needs to strive for hypergrowth.

# Warmth toward aspiring founders

This one was interesting.  I learned that not everybody will accept me as a legitimate founder.

Some founders are very welcoming and accommodating to other founders.  They're very eager to meet up and share their stories with me.  These founders are awesome.

Some other founders are less welcoming.  A few might challenge the reasons why you'd want to start up.  A few might rather talk about why you should join their startup rather than work on your own.

The welcoming founders are, thankfully, the larger of the two groups.  These guys gave me tons of inspiration.  I want to be like them one day.

I wouldn't go as far as to say the second group was unwelcoming, but there was much less warmth.  It was a little demoralizing to see that side of them, but it was educational for me too.  Not everybody will be supportive of your journey.

To be fair to the less welcoming founders, I haven't yet accomplished much, so I'm not yet a legitimate founder.  All that matters, really, is that I accept myself as a legitimate founder.

# Which side will you take?

Startup founders almost universally disagree on the proper way to start a company.  There's a lot of noise and variation here.  It's wise to choose a side before starting yourself.

Personally, I am very happy with my decision to bootstrap and to just try to cover my living expenses for the moment.  If I can accomplish that, I can set my scopes higher and possibly choose a different side.
