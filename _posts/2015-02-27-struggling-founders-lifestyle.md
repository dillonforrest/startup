title: "Struggling founder's lifestyle"
---

I was never a lavish spender, but my stinginess is making almost a full return to its historical peak. College was definitely my time for my most impressive frugality. My standard for living is still higher than college level (no shared bedrooms anymore for me, please), but shit, my drop in standards is still a verified plunge.

The new emotion that I feel now is what I call "poor buyer's remorse." I define poor buyer's remorse as regular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_remorse" target="_blank">buyer's remorse</a>, but taken to a socially abnormal extreme.

I am now a regular victim of poor buyer's remorse.

# Shitty bibimbap

A few weeks ago, I met up with a friend for lunch on a Saturday. She wanted to go to a Korean restaurant which has a strong reputation as a late night drunk food spot. I definitely didn't want to go there for lunch. But I said fuck it, if you wanna go, let's go.

I had a great time catching up with her as usual, but I can't believe I paid $18 USD for shitty bibimbap at that restaurant. I knew it was going to be bad food, but I agreed to go anyway. Having to pay that much money for food I didn't even like ended up aggravating me. Weeks later, I'm still annoyed that I paid that much money for shitty bibimbap.

I could have had two chipotle burrito bowls for that price, and I would have enjoyed both of them.

Eating out at restaurants is a huge luxury for me now. If I go out and spend money on restaurant food, I want to enjoy it, a lot, otherwise I'd rather save the money. The poor buyer's remorse that I gained that lunch was so suffocating that I stopped wanting to make restaurant exceptions for friends anymore. I know it's not cool or charismatic, and it's pretty selfish, but now I'm refusing to pay for restaurant food unless I know with certainty that I'll like the food. Otherwise, the money and the poor buyer's remorse isn't worth it.

# Bad haircut

I care a lot about my hair.

Up until a year ago, I had my hair cut by a stylist in Chinatown. Among Asian guys who love their hair, a Chinatown stylist is the bottom of the hair stylist totem pole. But I got lucky and found a guyat a relatively cozy Chinatown salon who cut my hair well for a good price.

Then, last year, I decided to splurge more on my hair. I started trying out other stylists, paying typical haircut rates at fancier salons. One of them was $80 for a haircut, about 2.5 times the amount I paid in Chinatown. However, I just couldn't find a stylist who was actually better than my Chinatown stylist, even though I consistently paid more.

I was so annoyed that I was paying more money for haircuts that I liked less. I figured it was my fault for not knowing how to communicate with my stylists. Eventually though, I got tired of seeing myself in the mirror and hating how ugly my hair was.

Yesterday, I said fuck it, enough is enough, I'll go back to my Chinatown stylist. I paid my normal Chinatown rate for my normal Chinatown haircut. I walked out with poor buyer's remorse fully washed out of my hair, finally.

I am a struggling founder. I am not above a Chinatown haircut.

# Restaurant week embarrassments

I still have two good friends from back in the days when I wanted to go into finance. They're two of my oldest friends, and they're both in New York now, so we want to make the most of it and hang out regularly.

They suggested going to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Restaurant_Week" target="_blank">Restaurant Week</a> dinner. My friend who was organizing it said we should bring our girlfriends and other friends from school.

I immediately said no. I'm too poor, I told them truthfully. New York's Restaurant Week means that super expensive and fancy restaurants offer prix fixe menus starting at $38 USD, a fraction of their normal prices. Discounted or not, $38 is still way too much for me.

My friends are super gracious. They didn't hesitate to offer to pay for me. They're awesome.

However, now there's an awkward dynamic with my girlfriend. I told her about the dinner, and she brought up a good point. Isn't that super weird if I bring her to a fancy dinner, but my friends pay for my bill?

As of this writing, I still don't know what to do about this dinner, but I don't want to make my girlfriend feel uncomfortable due to my own poor buyer's lifestyle.

# A lifestyle dip is imminent

I know people who tried to start up but refused to cut back on their lifestyles. You guys, what the fuck are you doing?? Are you guys trying to start a company or not??

When you work on your startup attempt full-time, your cash is your lifeblood. If your lifestyle doesn't give, your runway will.
