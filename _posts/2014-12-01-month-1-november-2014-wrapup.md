title: "Month 1: November 2014 wrapup"
---

This month was humbling.  I was hoping to find a product idea for which people would pay money.  However, I ultimately failed to do so.

# Completed

I invalidated several more product ideas.  Some of them were better than others.  For my goals, the only validation that I care about right now is willingness to pay, and I received none for any of my ideas just yet.

I also attempted to just speak to many local small businesses.  That turned out to be a bad use of time.  There are plenty of local small businesses with bad software, but the software isn't bad enough for them to want to switch to a newer solution.

# In progress

This hasn't changed from last month.  I'm still contemplating different problems to solve.

# Goals for next month

This also hasn't changed from last month.  I'd like to find and validate a product idea.

A great month would be one where I've received money to build a product out.

A good, but not great, month would be one where I learn a lot, but I still don't have a product idea for which I get paid.

A bad month would be one where I learn nothing while validating no ideas.

# Things I did well

#### I resisted the temptation to quit

I wrote about it at length <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/temptations-to-quit/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The temptations still arise, but I do a good job of resisting them.

#### I kept my spirits up

I did a better job of this than the previous month.  This month, I had much more managed expectations.  It was very difficult for me to feel disappointed about anything.  At the same time, I didn't really get excited about anything either.

I wanted to be more level-headed, and I definitely succeeded.

#### I reconsidered ways to find product ideas

I have a lot to say here, but I'm saving it for a post later this week.  In sum, I realized that signalling from other people can save me the work of validating a market or an idea for me.

# Things I wish I did better

#### Wasting my time

I wasted a good amount of time this month.  Some of it was from consulting for other people or being tempted to quit and join somebody else's startup.  Some of it was poor goal setting.  Some of it was poor decision making.

I ended up learning a lot anyway, but wasting time is still something I want to prevent in the future.  I can see it getting out of control if I don't pay attention to it.

# Things I learned

#### Shitty technology does not mean there's a market opportunity

This is the big lesson of the month.

I spent a lot of time talking to local small businesses who had shitty technology.  However, they turned out to be unwilling to spend on or switch to newer, sharper software.  Their painpoints simply weren't large enough to justify changing.

Shitty technology doesn't mean there's a market opportunity.  Simply being shitty does not signal a willingness to spend.  The pain has to be large enough to convince buyers that they want a change even without you pitching the possibility.

#### Set failable goals

I wrote about this <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-was-setting-goals-like-an-idiot/" target="_blank">here</a>.

My buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule" target="_blank">Sam DeBrule</a> taught me this.  It's probably common sense to most people, but it wasn't to me.  Like how an effective hypothesis is falsifiable, an effective goal is failable.

# Numbers

Revenue:  $0

Technically, I made some money from consulting.  But that was money made with an hourly freelance rate.  It wasn't made by selling products.  So I still count my revenue to be precisely zero.

Maybe it's arrogent of me, but at the beginning of this month, I really didn't expect to still be making no money by this month's end.

A humbler, wiser Dillon completes Month 1 and proceeds into Month 2...
