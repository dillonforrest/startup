title: "Month 2: December 2014 wrapup"
---

I had low expectations for this month due to the holiday. I ended up working only two weeks. This month still saw some interesting progress though.

# Completed

This month was primarily spent attempting to validate one specific new product idea.

The idea was broadly a user analytics tool for single-page apps. I spoke with a few people and luckily connected on a few cold emails with other companies to discuss this value proposition. However, ultimately I felt that I didn't know enough about analytics to deliver on an analytics tool.

I also considered creating tools simply to track user behaviors in web apps. It seems like a growing area in which some people are making money. However, I couldn't really find an underserved market segment. Worse, I couldn't find any meaningful way to even access potential customers. This is my distribution problem coming back to haunt me.

Special thanks to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlSednaoui" target="_blank">Carl Sednaoui</a> for helping out majorly on those last two ideas! His marketing expertise and experience building <a href="http://www.mailcharts.com/" target="_blank">MailCharts</a> helped me out a lot.

# In Progress

At the end of my working time in December, I came across two different types of value propositions to pursue.

One is helping software development agencies save time while scoping proposals. My twitter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/timchilcott" target="_blank">Tim Chilcott</a> runs an agency himself, called <a href="https://twitter.com/timchilcott" target="_blank">sofetch.io</a>, and he introduced this problem to me. I'm hoping to do more market research on it in the next week or two.

Another is giving a support community to lonely builders, including entrepreneurs and developers like myself. This is inspired by <a href="http://hashtagnomads.com/" target="_blank">#nomads</a> by <a href="https://levels.io/" target="_blank">Pieter Levels</a>. I'm not quite sure what the specific userbase or value proposition should be just yet, but I'm hoping to help lonely builders feel less lonely.

Ultimately, the most pressing in-progress issue is that I still lack meaningful problems to solve and I struggle finding people who want to pay me to solve them.

# Goals for next month

My goals for the next month are, yet again, repeating my goals originally for last month. I need to find and validate a product idea.

I'm definitely a bit frustrated about still searching. However, I also accept that it might take some time.

One of the cofounders at my previous <a href="http://triplelift.com/" target="_blank">company</a>, Shaun Zacharia, said that it took him and his partner maybe a full year before they really hit something meaningful. Years later, his venture is growing, hiring, selling, and raising capital. (Aside: Shaun gave me a lot of support as I was on my way out of his company to try to start my own. Thanks Shaun!)

I probably remember Shaun's words every day now to stay calm. Slow and steady wins the race. These things could take years.

# Things I did well

## Better blog posts

I wrote two blog posts last month which were much better received than all my previous posts. One was a <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-cant-make-money-from-local-small-businesses/" target="_blank">lengthy post</a> explaining why I didnt feel I could make money off of local small businesses. <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/can-i-compete-with-an-existing-idea/" target="_blank">Another</a> contemplated the notion of competing with existing ideas rather than creating new ideas.

## Better perspective

One of the cool things to happen last month was meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbpetersen" target="_blank">John Petersen</a>. He was gracious enough to listen to my startup woes and commented that it seemed I wasn't passionate about any particular problem. He interpreted it as a reason why I couldn't validate product ideas very easily.

Immediately I realized John was correct. My passion is web development. My original goal was to help people ship web applications faster. It's a semantic argument at this point, but I'd argue that my passion and original goals are more aligned with coming up with solutions rather than solving a specific problem.

Frankly, when your main interest is programming, the easiest way to make money with your interests is simply to start a consultancy, which simply isn't an acceptable outcome for me right now. I want to decouple the relationship between the time I put in and the money I get out. I want to sell products, not labor.

Programming is cool because you can build solutions, but programming itself doesnt show you all the problems that need to be solved. There are certainly opportunities within software development itself, such as dev tools, but I'd say that programming generally is difficult to turn into a product.

# Numbers

Revenue:  $0

Not surprised I didn't make any money last month. It was December after all. I was going to be on holiday, and all my contacts were going to be on holiday. But really, I don't think I can tolerate another zero-revenue month from myself.
