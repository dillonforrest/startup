title: "Building is easy, selling is hard"
---

There's a huge demand for developers and technical cofounders right now.  Despite this demand, as a developer who's now in his eighth week of full-time effort trying to start a company, I can definitely say that code is the easy part.

Building your product is easy.  It can even be fun.  There are people who look at code and design and product as an articistic extension of themselves.

On the other hand, selling is hard.  It's so, so, so fucking hard.  My friend William <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-cant-make-money-from-local-small-businesses/#comment-1730324926" target="_blank">said it well</a>:

> A business, any business, really just boils down to a people finding mission.

Every step of the way towards building a successful product is just as much, or even moreso, a people finding mission as it is a technical product mission.

I'd wager that most startups today are built with mediocre technology.  They can still close business because they solved their marketing problems well.  They have distribution.  In the end, good technology and good engineering can help a company become great, but it's only a nice-to-have.  Good distribution and product/market fit are the only must-haves.

Some engineers might idealistically say that only great engineers can build great companies.  I probably said something like this when I was younger too.  But empirically this is false.  Most engineers don't want to work at the larger richer companies precisely because they were built by and are maintained by shitty engineers.  Great engineers don't want to work for or with shitty engineers.

I still believe that business value is maximized with great engineering.  However, there's no way rising revenues are solely predicated by great engineers.  Great engineers are not necessary to build a great company.

If I end up partnering with somebody to start a company together, I will be sure that he or she will be able to sell.  Eight weeks of work are telling me that I kind of suck at it.
