title: "Building is easy, selling is hard"
---

There's a huge demand for developers and technical cofounders right now.

As a developer who's now in his eighth week of full-time effort trying to start a company, I can definitely say that code is the easy part.

Building your product is easy.  It's fun actually.  There are people who look at code and design and product is an articistic extension of themselves.

On the other hand, selling is hard.  It's so, so, so fucking hard.  My friend and frequent commenter <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-cant-make-money-from-local-small-businesses/#comment-1730324926" target="_blank">William</a> said it well:

> A business, any business, really just boils down to a people finding mission. We are looking for people who will buy our product. So at the end of the day, it's just a matter of finding the right audience... wherever they may be.

Every step of the way towards building a successful product is just as much, or even moreso, a people finding mission than it is a technical product mission.

I'd wager that most startups today are built with mediocre technology.  They can still close business because they solved their marketing problems well.  They have distribution.  In the end, good technology and good engineering can help a company become great, but it's only a nice-to-have.  Good distribution and product/market fit are the only must-haves.

If I end up partnering with somebody to start a company together, I will be sure that he or she will be able to sell.  Eight weeks of work are telling me that I kind of suck at it.
