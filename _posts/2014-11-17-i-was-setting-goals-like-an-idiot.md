title: "I was setting goals like an idiot"
---

This is one of my more embarrassing posts in this blog.  Due to the degree of stupidity that I'm revealing, I'll keep this post brief.  :)

Last week, I shot the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNdyOdtFkAA" target="_blank">latest</a> Founders Gambit episode with my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule" target="_blank">Sam DeBrule</a>.  In the show, Sam talked to me about how he was setting goals.  He had a goal to grow his project by 35% each week, and he consistently hit his goals.

When he told me this, I felt like a switch was flipped in my head.

I was having a bad stretch when I podcasted with Sam.  I was a hamster running on a wheel, scrambling and putting in work, but not actually going anywhere.  My goal for the week was to "generate and test more product ideas."  However, day after day, I didn't feel any closer to the goal of having a product that customers would pay for.

My goal wasn't specific and quanitifiable like Sam's goal.  My problem was that my goals were impossible to fail.  If a goal is too broad to fail, it's probably too broad to be meaningful.

# A meaningful goal is a failable goal

So, like Sam, I now set my goals with numbers or some other objective method to measure success.  Today is the start of Week 5 for me.  My goal is to talk to 20 businesses about their problems.  By the end of the week, I'll know with extreme precision how well I did.

Failable goals should be obvious to most people, but unfortunately it wasn't for me.  Ugh, Dillon.

No more setting goals like an idiot for me.  Being an idiot is something I can't afford.
