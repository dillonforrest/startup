title: "The prerequisite to starting up while employed"
---

The least risky way to start a startup is on the side while employed and earning a salary. You go to your job during the day. On nights and weekends, you work on your side project. Then, if your side project is earning reasonable money itself, you can forgo your salary and focus on your project full-time as a startup. Most people have a low risk profile and prefer to start companies this way.

That's not what I did. I didn't have any real business ideas or customers when I started. I literally started from <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/i-want-to-start-a-company/" target="_blank">zero</a>. I always wanted to start side projects while at my last job. However, I was always too fatigued on nights and weekends to do anything productive. I eventually thought that I just wasn't one of those people who had the mental capability to work on nights and weekends. So, unfortunately, my employer always received any productive energy that I had.

I thought I was capable of working on only one project at a time. So, I quit my job to try to solve problems and start a company.

That was five months ago now. With five months of space between me and my last job, I realize now I was wrong. Yes, I totally do have the capability to work nights and weekends. I work almost every night and weekend these days. The reason why I couldn't muster any productivity while at my last job was because my job sucked. It literally sucked the vitality out of me.

When you hate your job, your life becomes a trance. You go to work, you check out because you don't care, you finally get to leave at the end of the day, and when you get home you're too tired from not caring to do any real work for yourself. I was always, always, always fatigued. No matter how much I slept on weekends, I felt like clouds in my brain fogged every single thought.

The right move for me would have been to find a better job when I realized I hated my job, not ride it out like <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/if-i-could-redo-my-startup-preparation/" target="_blank">I chose to</a>. I should have found a job that I found exciting. That way, I'd have the energy to not just perform well on the job, but also work on a side project.

That, to me, is the prerequisite to starting up while employed. Your employment needs to give you energy. It can't suck away your energy.
