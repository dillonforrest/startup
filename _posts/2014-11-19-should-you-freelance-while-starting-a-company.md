title: "Should you freelance while starting a company?"
---

Most of the time, no, you should not freelance while starting a company.  I learned this lesson in the last week, from my own experiences plus several friends telling me the same.

# Freelancing is a slippery slope back to employment

My buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/DustinWOliver" target="_blank">Dustin Oliver</a> shared a story with me today.  He has two friends who attempted to start a company together.  Let's call them Eddie and Christine.  Eddie is a bright designer/front-end guy, and Christine is a bright front-end/back-end girl.  That's a solidly technical founding team.

They both quit their jobs to work on their startup attempt full-time.  But, to pay bills, they did consulting while also launching their company.

The most lucrative consulting gigs were with the biggest clients.  So they took contracts with the biggest clients.  However, bigger clients have not just deeper pockets, but also bigger demands.

Both Eddie and Christine ended up spending all their time consulting.  None of their work went into their own business.

Five months later, Eddie and Christine ended up throwing in the towel.  They went their separate ways and got full-time jobs at separate companies.  Their startup attempt reduced to just a lengthy transition between jobs.

# Freelancing is not the correct method to receive money

If you want to create a business, you probably want to decouple the relationship between your time spent working and your income.  You probably want to make money by selling products, not by working for an hourly wage or an annualized salary.

Freelancing is just more of the thing you're avoiding:  trading off your time directly for money.

# The cool kids avoid freelancing

Earlier today, I was chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/Swaldy" target="_blank">Spencer Walden</a> about our respective startup attempts.  Spencer and I have very similar startup goals.  He mentioned that he would avoid freelancing as long as possible.

I'm joining Spencer.  I'm also avoiding freelancing as long as possible.

Be like me and Spencer.  Be a cool kid.  Succumb to my friendly peer pressure and avoid freelancing.  ;)

# Consulting is a last resort

If I run out of money and need to draw a salary to pay bills, I will finally reconsider consulting.  At that point, maybe I'll be openminded to full-time employment again, and maybe I'll just get a normal job.

That's all a future possibility.  In the present, I want to focus all my energy on my own goals.

# My part-time consulting gig

Last week, I did some <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/startup/temptations-to-quit/" target="_blank">part-time consulting work</a>.  This week, my client and I both realized that it wasn't going to work out any longer.  On my end, I felt like I committed too much time to consulting.  On his end, he felt like I didn't commit enough time.

I learned a lot from my client, and I'm grateful for the experience.  I learned about how to be a good freelancer, and I especially learned that freelancing is a bad idea for me.

Sometimes the only way to learn these lessons is the hard way.
