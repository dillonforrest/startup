title: "Introversion and entrepreneurship don't mix"

My Myers-Briggs personality test scores for my introvertedness and extrovertedness are almost even.  The scale tips slightly toward introvert.  In my belief, two-thirds of American adults are probably introverts, at minimum as introverted as me.

My tendencies for introversion are not strong.  But I learned a tough lesson this week about being an introverted founder.

## Most goals for an early-stage founder require extroversion

I'm not saying that introverts can't be founders.  That's probably false.  But as an introverted founder, I've had to step away from the laptop more often than comfortable.

Founders have certain tasks which are inappropriate to outsource or delegate.  They're inherently the duties of a founder.  The reality is that many of these tasks require stepping beyond my social comfort zone and talking to many people.  They require extroverted behavior to an extent which simply can't be normal for the average introvert.

Let's look at some of these early-stage founder tasks that I've faced so far and how extroversion plays its role.

### Understanding a market

Or, as others put it, "talking to users."

To understand my market better, I've had to reach out and meet many more people in the last two weeks than I ever have in any other two-week period in recent memory.

As a developer, reaching out and meeting people is not fun work.  It requires syncing my schedule with other schedules.  I can't just plug in my headphones and write code at my leisure.  I can't drown out the distractions and focus by myself.

Plugging in my headphones and writing code is not understanding my market and talking to potential users.  I have to force myself off my laptop and go meet people.

### Validating a product idea

Validating a product idea is a step further from simply understanding users.  Validating a product idea is much tougher.  There's always a chance of rejection when you seek to validate a product idea.

Facing rejection is tough.  But rejection is just another chance to gather information.  It's important, but it doesn't happen without me seeking input from others and stepping away from my laptop.

Besides, when a founder attempts to validate a product idea and gets negative feedback from potential users, the users aren't rejecting the founder.  The users are rejecting the product idea.  There's a huge learning opportunity there.

### Reaching out for advice

To be frank, I haven't ever truly certain that I know what I'm doing.

Luckily, I'm in New York City.  There are tons of founders here.  Maybe I can reach out and ask for help.

Reaching out for help is important especially for first-time founders.  I'm quite aware that I don't even know what I don't know.  Ideally, I'd progress to knowing what I don't know as quickly as possible.  Being in New York can help to facilitate this process.

The first step to asking for advice is stepping out from my comfort zone and saying hi to a stranger.

### Evangelizing yourself and your value proposition

Self-promotion is not natural for an introvert.  For me, it feels indulgent and just incorrect.  But as a founder, I must evangelize myself as a trustworthy business leader and my value proposition as one worth a customer's money.

This is the hardest part for me to stomach.  But a founder must sell.

## Selling is the foundation of entrepreneurship

The importance of selling is ultimately why I believe introversion and entrepreneurship don't mix.

Being an introvert as a personality tendency is probably fine.  An introvert founder still needs to be able to sell though.  To me, selling mandates at least some extroverted behavior sure to be beyond an introvert's preference.  Being incapable or unwilling to be extroverted is probably the first step towards failing to sell.
