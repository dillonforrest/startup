title: "Introversion and entrepreneurship don't mix"

My Myers-Briggs personality test scores for my introvertedness and extrovertedness are almost even.  The scale tips slightly toward introvert.  In my belief, probably two-thirds of American adults are introverts, at minimum as introverted as me.

My tendencies for introversion are not strong.  But even still, I learned a tough lesson this week about being an introverted founder.

## Most goals for an early-stage founder require extroversion

I'm not saying that introverts can't be founders.  That's probably false.  But as an introverted founder, I've had to step away from my laptop more often than comfortable.

Founders have certain tasks which are inappropriate to outsource or delegate.  They're inherently the duties of a founder.  The reality is that many of these tasks require stepping beyond my social comfort zone and talking to many people.  They require extroverted behavior to an extent which simply can't be normal for the average introvert.

Let's look at some of these early-stage founder tasks that I've faced so far and how extroversion plays its role.

### Understanding a market

Or, as others put it, "talking to users."

To understand my market better, I've had to reach out and meet many more people in the last two weeks than I ever have in any other two-week period in recent memory.

As a developer, reaching out and meeting people is not fun work.  It requires syncing my schedule with other schedules.  I can't just plug in my headphones and write code at my leisure.  I have to take in information asynchronously as people find time to communicate, rather than synchronously when I can read everything for myself.  I can't drown out the distractions and focus by myself.

Unfortunately, plugging in my headphones and writing code has nothing to do with understanding my market and talking to potential users.  I have to force myself off my laptop and go meet people.

### Facing rejection

I envision rejection being a real possibility in any stage of developing a product and most tasks for a founder.  So far, I'm seeing it when I attempt to validate a product idea.  I'm sure more rejection will follow even if my product idea is validated.

Facing rejection is tough.  To look at the glass half-full, rejection is just another chance to gather information.  It's important, but it doesn't happen without me seeking input from others and stepping away from my laptop.

Let's hone in on my specific task at hand, validating a product idea, and see how rejection isn't actually that bad.  When a founder attempts to validate a product idea and gets negative feedback from potential users, the users aren't rejecting the founder.  The users are rejecting the product idea.  There's a huge learning opportunity there only made possible by doing the tough thing and facing the possibility of rejection.

### Reaching out for advice

I haven't ever been truly certain that I know what I'm doing.

Luckily, I'm in New York City.  There are tons of founders here.  Maybe I can reach out and ask for advice.

Reaching out for advice is important especially for first-time founders.  I'm quite aware that I don't even know what I don't know.  A lack of knowledge at this level is so profound that it's sheer blindness.  Ideally, I'd progress to knowing what I don't know as quickly as possible.  Then, I'd have my sights on some sort of guiding north star.  Being in New York can help to facilitate this process with its rich and growing startup scene.

The first step to asking for advice is stepping out from my comfort zone and saying hi to a stranger.

### Evangelizing yourself and your value proposition

Self-promotion is not natural for an introvert.  For me, it feels indulgent and just incorrect.  But as a founder, I must evangelize myself as a trustworthy business leader and my value proposition as one worth a customer's money.  Ultimately, I must take these steps so I can sell.

The evangelizing is the hardest part for me to stomach.  But evangelizing enables the sell, and a founder must sell.

## Selling is the foundation of entrepreneurship

The importance of selling is ultimately why I believe introversion and entrepreneurship don't mix.

Being an introvert as a personality tendency is probably fine.  An introvert founder still needs to be able to sell though.  To me, selling mandates at least some extroverted behavior sure to be beyond an introvert's preference.  Being incapable or unwilling to be extroverted is probably the first step towards failing to sell.
