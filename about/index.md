Hi, my name is <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/" target="_blank">Dillon</a>. I used to be a front-end developer at a few advertising companies. I'm a <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> alum.

In October 2014, I quit my job to try to start a company. I had no business idea, customers, or product. I had only the fire to solve real problems, figure out this entrepreneurship thing, and avoid the draining rat race of employment out of necessity rather than choice.

My blog details all my hard-earned lessons learned along the way, starting from zero.
