title: This blog is about my startup journey
---

Hi, my name is <a href="http://www.dillonforrest.com/" target="_blank">Dillon</a>.  This is my blog detailing the ups and downs of my first startup attempt.

In October 2014, I quit my job.  I decided to start a company.  I decided to start a blog for other entrepreneurs, whether entrepreneurship is in their past, present, or future.

I want to inform my readers.  I want to inspire my readers.  I want to entertain my readers.

As a new entrepreneur, my first goal is to find a problem worth solving, one which I can solve myself.  Some Lean Startup followers call this *problem/solution fit*.  If I work hard, work smart, and get lucky, the next goal will be finding *product/market fit*.  And if things continue to work out, the following goal will be *scaling*.

But till then, I start from zero.

**From the "aww yeahh" moments to the "ohh SHITT" moments, I'm sharing everything on my journey through problem/solution fit, to product/market fit, to scaling.  I'm going to learn a lot.  So will you.**
